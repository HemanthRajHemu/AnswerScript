			<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1 Cyber Attack:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	cyberattack is any type of offensive maneuver that targets computer
	information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or personal
	computer devices. An attacker is a person or process that attempts to
	access data, functions or other restricted areas of the system without
	authorization, potentially with malicious intent. Depending on context,
	cyberattacks can be part of

		cyberwarfare

	or

		cyberterrorism

	. A cyberattack can be employed by

		sovereign states

	, individuals, groups, society or organizations, and it may originate from
	an anonymous source.
</p>
<p>
	A cyberattack may steal, alter, or destroy a specified target by

		hacking

into a susceptible system. Cyberattacks can range from installing	spyware
	on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of
	entire nations. Legal experts are seeking to limit the use of the term to
	incidents causing physical damage, distinguishing it from the more routine

		data breaches

	and broader
		hacking

	activities.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.2 Motives of Cyber Attacks:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The sheer thrill of mounting a successful cyber-attack has been motivation
	enough for hackers (Table 1.1)

	Table 1.1 Notable cyber attacks
</p>
<p>
	Most hackers were (and still are) young adults, often teens, who had
	dropped out of school but were otherwise intelligent and focused. Many of
	the "traditional" hackers seem to be obsessive programmers. They seem to be
	adept at circumventing limitations to achieve a challenging but often
	forbidden objective.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, there is a tribe of script kiddies - juveniles who use scripts
	and attack kits designed by others (these can be freely downloaded from the
	Internet). Their activities do not require any special programming skills
	or advanced knowledge of computer systems.
</p>
<p>
	Other perpetrators of cyber-attacks include company insiders, often
	disgruntled employees who. wish to even scores with their employers. There
	is also a serious threat from cyber terrorists who espouse extreme
	religious or political causes. Cyber terrorism is one weapon in their
	impressive arsenal which may include biological, chemical, and nuclear
	weapons. Their goals are to cripple the information/communication systems
	of the financial and business institutions of their "enemies."
</p>
<p>
	Some of the main motives of launching cyber-attacks are:
</p>
<p>
	1. Theft of sensitive information.
</p>
<p>
	2. Disruption of service.
</p>
<p>
	3. Illegal access to or use of resources
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.2.1 Theft of sensitive information.</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Many organizations store and communicate sensitive information.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Information on new products being designed or revenue sources can be
	hugely advantageous to a company's competitors.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Likewise, details of military installations or precise military plans
	can be of immense value to a nation's adversaries.
</p>
<p>
	iv. Political spying targeted at government ministries and national
	intelligence can HAVE many sensitive operations planned for the future.
</p>
<p>
	v. Besides corporations, banks, the military, intelligence, etc., the
	individual too has increasingly been a target.
</p>
<p>
	vi. Leakage of personal information such as credit card numbers, passwords,
	and even personal spending habits are common and are collectively referred
	to as identity theft. Such information is advertised on certain websites
	and may be purchased for a small fee.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.2.2 Disruption of service.</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Interruption or disruption of service is launched against an
	organization's servers so they are made unavailable or inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
	ii. In recent times, there have been unconfirmed reports of such attacks
	being launched by business rivals of e-commerce websites.
</p>
<p>
	iii. The goal here appears to be "my competitor's loss is my gain." In
	2001, there were a series of such attacks that targeted the websites of
	Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. in a short span of time.
</p>
<p>
	iv. They were meant to alert corporates and others of the dangers of this
	class of attacks.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.2.3 Illegal access to or use of resources</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. The goal here is to obtain free access or service to paid services.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Examples of this include free access to online digital products such as
	magazine or journal articles, free talk time on someone else's account,
	free use of computing power on a supercomputer, etc.
</p>
<p>
	iii. In each case, the attacker is able to circumvent controls that permit
	access to only paid subscribers of such services.

			<div class="ansclass  animate-bottom" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
    <strong><h2>2.1 Extended Euclidean Algorithm:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The formal procedure to obtain the inverse of c modulo b is called the
    Extended Euclidean Algorithm and ts presented next. It assumes that b and c
    are relatively prime.
</p>

    <strong><h2>
        2.2 We use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (Fig. 2.1) to compute the
        inverse of 12 modulo 79 (b = 79 and c = 12)
    </h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Table 2.2 tracks the values of b’, c’, q, r, old1, new1, old2, and new2 at
    the end of each iteration. The invariant, new1 x b + new2 x c = r is
    maintained across all iterations. At the end of the last iteration r = 1
    and the invariant is
</p>
<p>
    (-5) x 79 + 33 x 12 =1,
</p>
<p>
    or
</p>
<p>
    12 * 33 = 1+5 * 79 = 1 (mod 79)
</p>
<p>
    Thus, the inverse of 12 modulo 79 is 33.

			<p>
	The <strong><h2>Vigenere cipher</h2></strong> is a <strong><h2>polyalphabetic</h2></strong>
that uses a multi-digit cipher key,	<strong><h2>k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, &#8230;, k<sub>m</sub>, </h2></strong>
	Here, k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, &#8230;, k<sub>m</sub>, are each
	integer. The <strong><h2>plaintext</h2></strong> is split into non-overlapping
blocks, each containing <strong><h2>m consecutive characters</h2></strong>. Then the<strong><h2>first letter</h2></strong> of each block is replaced by the letter	<strong><h2>k<sub>1</sub>,</h2></strong> positions to its right, the second letter
	of each block is replaced by the letter <strong><h2>k<sub>2</sub></h2></strong>,
	positions to its right, and so on.

<p>
	The first letter in the above text is W. The corresponding key is 04. This

</p>
<p>
	The key length = 8, i.e., the key string repeats after every 8 characters.
</p>
<p>
	There are four occurrences of the letter "s" in the above text (for
	simplicity we do not distinguish between upper and lower case letters).
	However, each occurrence of "s" is encrypted as a different character in
	the cipher text - "V", "X", "O" and "Z".

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 5<h1>Describe the types of Vulnerabilities to domain of security. (4-Marks)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass  animate-bottom" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	There are at least tour important vulnerability classes in the domain of
	security:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>5.1 Human Vulnerabilities:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	These are vulnerabilities caused by human behaviour or action.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	For example, the user clicks on a link in an e-mail message received from a
	questionable source. By so doing, the user can be directed to a site
controlled by the attacker as in a	<strong><h2>phishing attack or a cross-site scripting attack</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
Similarly clicking on an e-mail attachment may open up a document causing a	<strong><h2>macro</h2></strong> <strong><h2>to be executed.</h2></strong><sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>macro may be designed to infect other files</h2></strong> on the
	system and/or spread the infected e-mail to other e-mail addresses
	harvested from the victim's inbox.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
In both these cases, the<strong><h2>human vulnerability consists of clicking on a link or</h2></strong><strong><h2>attachment in an e-mail from a possibly unknown source.</h2></strong>	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>link or attachment</h2></strong> may have provoked the victim by a
	flashy message suggesting quick money, etc., blinding him/her to the fact
	that the message came from an unknown source.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	It is actions like this that make a phishing attack or an e-mail virus so
	very successful.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>5.2 Protocol Vulnerabilities:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2> </h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
A number of networking protocols including	<strong><h2>TCP, IP, ARP, ICMP, UDP, DNS</h2></strong>, and various protocols used
	in local area networks (LANs) have features that have been used in
	unanticipated ways to craft assorted attacks.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Pharming attacks and various <strong><h2><em>hijacking attacks</em></h2></strong>
	are some examples.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are tools available<strong><h2><em>on-line to facilitate some of these attacks.</em></h2></strong>	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	One such tool subverts the normal functioning of the ARP protocol to sniff
	passwords from a LAN.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are a number of vulnerabilities in the<strong><h2><em>design of security protocols</em></h2></strong> that lead to	<strong><h2><em>replay or man-in-the-middle attacks.</em></h2></strong><sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	These attacks, in turn, lead to identity theft, compromise of secret keys,
	etc.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Vulnerabilities in network protocols are often related to aspects of their
	design though they may also be the result of poor implementation or
	improper deployment.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>5.3 Software Vulnerabilities:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	This family of vulnerabilities is caused by written system or application
	software.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	In many cases, the causes of the problem seem to be the code that is all
	too trusting of user input.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Ex A web server accepts input from a user's browser. the web server must
	accept the request after typing the complete username and password. the
	server software should perform sufficient validation.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>5.4 </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Configuration Vulnerabilities:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	These relate to configuration settings on newly installed applications,
	files, etc.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2><em>Read-write-execute </em></h2></strong>
permissions on files may be too generous and susceptible to	<strong><h2><em> </em></h2></strong>abuse.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The privilege level assigned to a process may be higher than what it should
	be to carry out a task. This privilege may be misused during some point in
	its execution leading to what are commonly called "privilege escalation"
	attacks.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Besides misconfiguration of software and services, security appliances such
	as firewalls may be incorrectly or incompletely configured with possibly
	devastating effect.<sup></sup>
