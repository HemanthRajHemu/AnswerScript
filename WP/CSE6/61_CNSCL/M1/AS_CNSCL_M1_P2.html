			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript1')">Question 6<h1>List the guiding principles of security. (4-Marks)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass  animate-bottom" id="ANScript1">
			
<p>
	The Guiding Principles of Security are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.1 </strong>
	<strong>
		Security is as much (or more) a human problem than a technological
		problem and must be addressed at different levels.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	At the highest level, security should be addressed by top-level management
	in large organizations.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Robust security policies should be formulated and a comprehensive
	implementation strategy outlined by a dedicated team of security
	specialists, possibly headed by a Chief Information Security Officer
	(CISO).<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Some of the mechanisms used to implement high-level policies are in the
	realm of technology.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Security engineers have a key role to play in designing techniques and
products to protect organizations from the various cyber attacks.	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	System administrators handle day-to-day operations.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	They should be proactive in crucial security practices such as patch
	application.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	One of the key tasks of a system administrator is to configure systems and
	applications. Their job also involves setting user/group permissions to
	various system resources such as files, configuring firewalls, sifting
through system logs for signs of an intrusion, and processing alerts.	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The final link in the security chain is the rank and file within an
	organization.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The employees within an organization should be educated on various do's and
	don'ts through periodically updated security awareness programs.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	In summary, a healthy combination of enlightened security policy and
	procedures, backed by enforcement, aided by technology, coupled with
	diligent<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	participation of administrators and employees, and presided over by an
	empowered CISO is the surest insurance against cyber attacks.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.2 </strong>
	<strong>
		Security should be factored in at inception, not as an afterthought.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	No one then had thought that those protocols would be abused by attackers
	in so many creative ways!<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Application software (web software, for example) developed today continues
	to be often vulnerable to numerous attacks such as cross-site scripting and
	SQL injection attacks.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The solution lies, at least in part, in integrating secure coding practices
	into the software curriculum in our colleges and universities.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	In general, security should be factored in early on during the design phase
	of a new product and then carried forward right through implementation and
	testing.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The product could be a networking protocol, a new version of an operating
	system, a piece of application software, or the architectural layout of
	computing infrastructure for an enterprise.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.3 </strong>
	<strong>Security by obscurity (or by complexity) is often bogus.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	There have been a number of cryptographic algorithms proposed which was
	made mandatory in newly standardized protocols, but their details were not
	made public.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The flaws are exposed over time after the protocols have been widely
	deployed, attracting closer attention from the hacker community.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	There are ethical hackers whose goal is to break software/
	protocols/algorithms so that they can be fixed before things get out of
	hand.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	It is the ethical hacker community at least, if not the public at large,
	who should be able to study new protocols and algorithms prior to
	widespread adoption.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	One such example was the procedure followed for selecting an algorithm in
	the late 1990s for the new secret key cryptography standard - AES was
	finally chosen after much public scrutiny and debate. As another example,
	open source software is usually freely available. Public review of its
	security features can make or break its reputation.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.4 </strong>
	<strong>
		Always consider the "Default Deny" policy for adoption in access
		control.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The subjects in an access control policy could be people, network packets,
	operating system processes or even user input.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	One policy is the "Default Permit," i.e., grant the subject's request
	unless the subject is on a blacklist or it has certain blacklisted
	attributes.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The dual of this policy is the "Default Deny" policy. In this case, the
	subject's request is denied unless it is on a whitelist.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Clearly, whitelisting is the more conservative approach.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	With whitelisting, the access controller may reject a legitimate subject
	whose name has been mistakenly excluded from the whitelist but that is the
	price to be paid for greater security.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Blacklisting, on the other hand, may accept a bad guy because his name or
	attributes were mistakenly excluded from the blacklist.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The trade-offs between blacklisting and whitelisting should be carefully
	examined (see Principle 8). However, in general, prudent security design
	should seriously consider adoption of the "Default Deny" policy.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.5 </strong>
	<strong>
		An entity should be given the least amount/level of
		permissions/privileges to accomplish a given task.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Role-based access control (RBAC) has influenced a variety of software
platforms ranging from operating systems to database management systems.	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The principal idea in RBAC is that the mapping between roles and
	permissions is paramount.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The role played by an individual at a given point in time determines the
	rights or privileges the individual has.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Conferring higher privilege on an individual than what is warranted by
	his/her current role could compromise the system.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Privilege escalation in its different manifestations has caused many
	security breaches in computer systems.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
The problem often lies in sloppy or incomplete configuration management.	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	In publicly accessible servers within an organization such as the web and
	e-mail servers, unnecessary services hosted by them can open the door to
	malware, which can compromise those servers. The latter are then used as a
springboard to spread to the internal machines in that organization.	<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.6 </strong>
	<strong>
		Use 'Defence in depth' to enhance security of an architectural design
	</strong>
	<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	This principle is used in many high-security installations and has been
	recently introduced in some airports. A passenger's ticket is checked
	before entering the airport terminal building. This is followed by
	verification of travel documents and inspection of check-in baggage at the
	airline counter.
</p>
<p>
	Next comes a security check (physical) and a further check of the boarding
	pass, travel documents, and check-in baggage before entering the boarding
	area (main concourse).<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Defence in depth is applicable to cyber security as well.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Consider designing the firewall architecture for a mid-to-large size
	enterprise.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Every packet from the outside (Internet) should be intercepted by at least
	two firewalls.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The firewalls may be from two different vendors and would, preferably, have
	been configured by two different system administrators.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	They may, and typically do, have some overlapping functionality. Because of
	differences in the hardware/software design and in configuration, what
	escapes Firewall 1 may be caught by Firewall 2 and vice versa.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>6.7 Identify vulnerabilities and respond appropriately.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We have already seen a large number of vulnerability types.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Vulnerabilities in software or protocols are well researched.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	But equally important are weakness/shortcomings in policy, procedures, and
	operations.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	How many organizations are geared to implement policies regarding the entry
	of visitors' laptops and PDAs?<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Or do they even have such policies in place? Such mobile devices and
	Bluetooth-enabled gadgets may transmit malware to unsuspecting stations
	within the organization.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Likewise, USB-enabled PCs may be victims of viruses residing on USB flash
	drives.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Often, these organizations have elaborate security infrastructure in the
	form of firewalls and intrusion detection systems. They securely guard the
	high-profile main entrance but blissfully ignore the security requirements
	of the less conspicuous side and rear doors.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Vulnerability detection and response brings to mind fast-spreading Internet
	scanning worms.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		6.8 Carefully study the trade-offs involving security before making
		any.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Engineering design often involves making trade-offs - cost versus
	performance, functionality versus chip area, etc.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	The previous principle highlighted an important trade-off - security versus
	cost.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Consider, for example, the area of electronic payment involving small
	purchases (say Rs. 10 or less). Such payments, called micropayments, may be
	made for digital goods such as on-line news-paper articles.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Payment schemes use some form of cryptography. The cryptographic overheads
	of these schemes, in terms of computation cost, can be high. Can we use
	cheaper (lower overhead) cryptography for micropayments? The downside here
	is that such cryptography is not as secure. But given the transaction
	amount, the risk of fraud is probably acceptable.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	In this case, we may be justified in trading off increased security for
	lower cost. Besides security versus cost, security versus performance is a
	trade-off often encountered.<sup></sup>
