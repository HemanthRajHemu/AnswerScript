			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<h2>
	7.1 Types of Multimedia Network Applications
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; Three broad categories of multimedia applications:
</p>
<p>
	1) Streaming stored audio/video
</p>
<p>
	2) Conversational voice/video-over-IP and
</p>
<p>
	3) Streaming live audio/video.
</p>
<h2>
	11.1.1 Streaming Stored Audio &amp; Video
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; The underlying medium is prerecorded video. For example: a movie.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; These prerecorded videos are placed on servers.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; The users send requests to the servers to view the videos on-demand.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Nowadays, many Internet companies provide streaming video. For
	example: YouTube.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Three key distinguishing features of streaming stored video:
</p>
<h2>
	1. Streaming
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; The client begins video playout within few seconds after it begins
	receiving the video from the server.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; At the same time,
</p>
<p>
	i) The client will be playing out from one location in the video.
</p>
<p>
	ii) The client will be receiving later parts of the video from the server.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; This technique avoids having to download the entire video-file
	before playout begins.
</p>
<h2>
	2. Interactivity
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; The media is prerecorded, so the user may pause, reposition or
	fast-forward through video-content.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; The response time should be less than a few seconds.
</p>
<h2>
	3. Continuous Playout
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; Once playout of the video begins, it should proceed according to the
	original timing of the recording.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; The data must be received from the server in time for its playout at
	the client. Otherwise, users experience video-frame skipping (or freezing).
</p>
<h2>
	11.1.2 Conversational Voice- and Video-over-IP
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; Real-time conversational voice over the Internet is often referred
	to as Internet telephony.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; It is also commonly called Voice-over-IP (VoIP).
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Conversational video includes the video of the participants as well
	as their voices.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Most of today&#8223;s voice applications allow users to create
	conferences with three or more participants.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Nowadays, many Internet companies provide voice application. For
	example: Skype &amp; Google Talk.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Two parameters are particularly important for voice applications:
</p>
<p>
	i. Timing considerations and
</p>
<p>
	ii. Tolerance of data loss
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Timing considerations are important because voice applications are
	highly delay-sensitive.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Loss-tolerant means
</p>
<p>
	Occasional loss only causes occasional glitches in audio playback &amp;
	these losses can be partially/fully hidden.
</p>
<h2>
	11.1.3 Streaming Live Audio &amp; Video
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; These applications are similar to broadcast radio, except that
	transmission takes place over Internet.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; These applications allow a user to receive a live radio transmitted
	from any corner of the world.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; For example: live cricket commentary.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Today, thousands of radio stations around the world are broadcasting
	content over the Internet.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Live broadcast applications have many users who receive the same
	audio program at the same time.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; The network must provide an average throughput that is larger than
	the video consumption rate.
</p>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 12<h1>Explain audio compression in internet. (8-Marks) (9b)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	Digital audio (including digitized speech and music) has significantly
	lower bandwidth requirements than video. Digital audio, however, has its
	own unique properties that must be considered when designing multimedia
	network applications. To understand these properties, let's first consider
	how analog audio (which humans and musical instruments generate) is
	converted to a digital signal:
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; The analog audio signal is sampled at some fixed rate, for example,
	at 8,000 samples per second. The value of each sample is an arbitrary real
	number.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Each of the samples is then rounded to one of a finite number of
	values. This operation is referred to as quantization. The number of such
	finite values- called quantization values-is typically a power of two, for
	example, 256 quantization values
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Each of the quantization values is represented by a fixed number of
	bits. For example, if there are 256 quantization values, then each
	value-and hence each audio sample-is represented by one byte. The bit
	representations of all the samples are then concatenated together to form
	the digital representation of the signal. As an example, if an analog audio
	signal is sampled at 8,000 samples per second and each sample is quantized
	and represented by 8 bits, then the resulting digital signal will have a
	rate of 64,000 bits per second. For playback through audio speakers, the
	digital signal can then be converted back-that is, decoded- to an analog
	signal. However, the decoded analog signal is only an approximation of the
	original signal, and the sound quality may be noticeably degraded (for
	example, high-frequency sounds may be missing in the decoded signal). By
	increasing the sampling rate and the number of quantization values, the
	decoded signal can better approximate the original analog signal. Thus (as
	with video), there is a trade-off between the quality of the decoded signal
	and the bit-rate and storage requirements of the digital signal.
</p>
<p>
	The basic encoding technique that we just described is called pulse code
	modulation (PCM). Speech encoding often uses PCM, with a sampling rate of
	8,000 samples per second and 8 bits per sample, resulting in a rate of 64
	kbps. The audio compact disk (CD) also uses PCM, with a sampling rate of
	44,100 samples per second with 16 bits per sample; this gives a rate of
	705.6 kbps for mono and 1.411 Mbps for stereo.
</p>
<p>
	PPM-encoded speech and music, however, are rarely used in the Internet.
	Instead, as with video, compression techniques are used to reduce the bit
	rates of the stream. Human speech can be compressed to less than 10 kbps
	and still be intelligible. A popular compression technique for near
	CD-quality stereo music is MPEG 1 layer 3, more commonly known as MP3. MP3
	encoders can compress to many different rates; 128 kbps is the most common
	encoding rate and produces very little sound degradation. A related
	standard is Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which has been popularized by
	Apple. As with video, multiple versions of a pre-recorded audio stream can
	be created, each at a different bit rate.
</p>
<p>
	Although audio bit rates are generally much less than those of video, users
	are generally much more sensitive to audio glitches than video glitches.
	Consider, for example, a video conference taking place over the Internet.
	If, from time to time, the video signal is lost for a few seconds, the
	video conference can likely proceed without too much user frustration. If,
	however, the audio signal is frequently lost, the users may have to
	terminate the session.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 13<h1>With diagram, explain interaction between client and server using RTSP. (8-Marks) (10a)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	Audio, video and SMIL presentations, etc., are often referred to as
	continuous media. (<a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SMIL</a> stands
	for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language; it is a document language
	standard, as is HTML. As its name suggests, SMIL defines how continuous
	media objects, as well as static objects, are synchronized in a
	presentation that unravels over time. An in-depth discussion of SMIL is
	beyond the scope of this book.) Users typically want to <em>control</em>
	the playback of continuous media by pausing playback, repositioning
	playback to a future or past point of time, visual fast-forwarding
	playback, visual rewinding playback, etc. This functionality is similar to
	what to a user has with a VCR when watching a video cassette or with a CD
	player when listening to CD music. To allow a user to control playback, the
	media player and server need a protocol for exchanging playback control
	information. RTSP, defined in RFC 2326, is such a protocol.
</p>
<p>
	But before getting into the details of RTSP, let us indicate what RTSP does
	not do:
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; RTSP does not define compression schemes for audio and video.
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; RTSP does not define the how audio and video is encapsulated in
	packets for transmission over a network; encapsulation for streaming media
	can be provided by RTP or by a proprietary protocol. (RTP is discussed in
	Section 6.4) For example, RealMedia's G2 server and player use RTSP to send
	control information to each other. But the media stream itself can be
	encapsulated RTP packets or with some proprietary RealNetworks scheme.
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; RTSP does not restrict how the the streamed media is transported; it
	can be transported over UDP or TCP.
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; RTSP does not restrict how the media player buffers the audio/video.
	The audio/video can be played out as soon as it begins to arrive at the
	client, it can be played out after a delay of a few seconds, or it can be
	downloaded in its entirety before play out.

<p align="center">
	Fig 13.1: Interaction between client and server using RTSP
</p>
<p>
	The Web server encapsulates the presentation description file in an HTTP
	response message and sends the message to the browser. When the browser
	receives the HTTP response message, the browser invokes a media player
	(i.e., the helper application) based on the <code>content-type:</code>
	field of the message. The presentation description file includes references
	to media streams, using the URL method rtsp://, as shown in the above
	sample.
</p>
<p>
	As shown in Figure 13.1, the player and the server then send each other a
	series of RTSP messages. The player sends an RTSP SETUP request, and the
	server sends an RTSP SETUP response. The player sends an RTSP PLAY request,
	say, for lofi auido, and server sends RTSP PLAY response. At this point,
	the streaming server pumps the lofi audio into its own in-band channel.
	Later, the media player sends an RTSP PAUSE request, and the server
	responds with an RTSP PAUSE response. When the user is finished, the media
	player sends an RTSP TEARDOWN request, and the server responds with an RTSP
	TEARDOWN response.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 14<h1>Explain how streaming from streaming server to a media player is done. (8-Marks) (10b)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<h2>
	HTTP Streaming
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; The video is stored in an HTTP server as an ordinary file with a
	specific URL.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Here is how it works:
</p>
<p>
	1) When a user wants to see the video, the client
</p>
<p>
	&#8594; establishes a TCP connection with the server and
</p>
<p>
	&#8594; issues an HTTP GET request for that URL.
</p>
<p>
	2) Then, the server responds with the video file, within an HTTP response
	message.
</p>
<p>
	3) On client side, the bytes are collected in a client application buffer.
</p>
<p>
	4) Once no. of bytes in this buffer exceeds a specific threshold, the
	client begins playback.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Advantages:
</p>
<h2>
	1) Not Costly &amp; Complex
</h2>
<p>
	&#9641; Streaming over HTTP avoids the need for a media control server
	(RTSP).
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; This reduces the cost of deploying a large-scale application.
</p>
<h2>
	2) No Firewall Problem
</h2>
<p>
	&#9641; The use of HTTP over TCP also allows the video to traverse firewalls
	and NATs more easily.
</p>
<h2>
	3) Prefetching Video
</h2>
<p>
	&#9641; The client downloads the video at a rate higher than the consumption
	rate.
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; Thus, prefetching video-frames that are to be consumed in the
	future.
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; This pre-fetched video is stored in the client application buffer
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Nowadays, most video-streaming applications use HTTP streaming. For
	example: YouTube
</p>
<h2>
	14.1.1 Client Application Buffer &amp; TCP Buffers
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; Figure 5.1 illustrates the interaction between client and server for
	HTTP streaming.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; On the server side,
</p>
<p>
	i. The bytes of the video file are sent into the server's socket.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Then, the bytes are placed in the TCP send buffer before.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Finally, the bytes are transmitted into the Internet.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; On the client side,
</p>
<p>
	i. The application (media-player) reads bytes from the TCP receive-buffer
	(thro client-socket)
</p>
<p>
	ii. Then, the application places the bytes into the client-buffer.
</p>
<p>
	iii. At the same time, the application periodically
</p>
<p>
	a. grabs video-frames from the client-buffer
</p>
<p>
	b. decompresses the frames and
</p>
<p>
	c. displays the frames on the user's screen.

	Fig 14.1: Streaming stored video over HTTP/TCP
</p>
<h2>
	14.1.2 Early Termination &amp; Repositioning the Video
</h2>
<p>
	&#9635; HTTP streaming systems make use of the byte-range header in the HTTP
	GET request message.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Byte-range header specifies the range of bytes the client currently
	wants to retrieve from the video.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; This is particularly useful when the user wants to reposition to a
	future point in the video.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; When the user repositions to a new position, the client sends a new
	HTTP request.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; When server receives new HTTP request, the server sends the
	requested-bytes.
</p>
<p>
	&#9635; Disadvantage:
</p>
<p>
	&#9641; When a user repositions to a future point in the video, some
	pre-fetched-but-not-yet-viewed data will go unwatched. This results in a
	waste of bandwidth and server-resources.
