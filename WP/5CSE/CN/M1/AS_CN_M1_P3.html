			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
				
				<p>
	The HTTP specifications [RFC 1945; RFC 2616] include the definitions of the
	HTTP message formats. There are two types of HTTP messages, request
	messages and response messages, both of which are discussed below.
</p>
<p>
	HTTP Request Message
</p>
<p>
	Below we provide a typical HTTP request message:
</p>
<p>
	GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
</p>
<p>
	Host: www.someschool.edu
</p>
<p>
	Connection: close
</p>
<p>
	User-agent: Mozilla/5.0
</p>
<p>
	Accept-language: fr
</p>
<p>
	First of all, we see that the message is written in ordinary ASCII text, so
	that your ordinary computer-literate human being can read it. Second, we
	see that the message consists of five lines, each followed by a carriage
	return and a line feed. The last line is followed by an additional carriage
	return and line feed.
</p>
<p>
	Although this particular request message has five lines, a request message
	can have many more lines or as few as one line.
</p>
<p>
	The first line of an HTTP request message is called the request line; the
	subsequent lines are called the <strong>header lines</strong>. The request
	line has three fields: the method field, the URL field, and the HTTP
	version field. The method field can take on several different values,
	including GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE. The great majority of HTTP
	request messages use the GET method. The GET method is used when the
	browser requests an object, with the requested object identified in the URL
	field. In this example, the browser is requesting the object
	/somedir/page.html. The version is self-explanatory; in this example, the
	browser implements version HTTP/1.1.
</p>
<p>
Now let's look at the header lines in the example. The header line	<strong>Host:</strong> www.someschool.edu specifies the host on which the
	object resides. You might think that this header line is unnecessary, as
	there is already a TCP connection in place to the host.
</p>
<p>
	By including the <strong>Connection:</strong> close header line, the
	browser is telling the server that it doesn't want to bother with
	persistent connections; it wants the server to close the connection after
	sending the requested object.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>User-agent:</strong> header line specifies the user agent, that
	is, the browser type that is making the request to the server. Here the
	user agent is Mozilla/5.0, a Firefox browser. This header line is useful
	because the server can actually send different versions of the same object
	to different types of user agents. (Each of the versions is addressed by
	the same URL.)
</p>
<p>
	Finally, the <strong>Acceptlanguage:</strong> header indicates that the
	user prefers to receive a French version of the object, if such an object
	exists on the server; otherwise, the server should send its default
	version. The Accept-language: header is just one of many content
	negotiation headers available in HTTP.
</p>
<p>
	We see that the general format closely follows our earlier example. You may
	have noticed, however, that after the header lines (and the additional
	carriage return and line feed) there is an "entity body." The entity body
	is empty with the GET method, but is used with the POST method. An HTTP
	client often uses the POST method when the user fills out a form-for
	example, when a user provides search words to a search engine. With a POST
	message, the user is still requesting a Web page from the server, but the
	specific contents of the Web page depend on what the user entered into the
	form fields. If the value of the method field is POST, then the entity body
	contains what the user entered into the form
</p>

alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/><br/></center>
<p align="center">
	Fig: General format of an HTTP request message
</p>
<p>
	The HEAD method is similar to the GET method. When a server receives a
	request with the HEAD method, it responds with an HTTP message but it
	leaves out the requested object. Application developers often use the HEAD
	method for debugging. The PUT method is often used in conjunction with Web
	publishing tools. It allows a user to upload an object to a specific path
	(directory) on a specific Web server. The PUT method is also used by
	applications that need to upload objects to Web servers. The DELETE method
	allows a user, or an application, to delete an object on a Web server.
</p>
<p>
	HTTP Response Message
</p>
<p>
	Below we provide a typical HTTP response message. This response message
	could be the response to the example request message just discussed.
</p>
<p>
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</p>
<p>
	Connection: close
</p>
<p>
	Date: Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:44:04 GMT
</p>
<p>
	Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
</p>
<p>
	Last-Modified: Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:11:03 GMT
</p>
<p>
	Content-Length: 6821
</p>
<p>
	Content-Type: text/html
</p>
<p>
	(data data data data data ...)
</p>
<p>
	Let's take a careful look at this response message. It has three sections:
an <strong>initial status line, six header lines,</strong> and then the	<strong>entity body</strong>. The entity body is the meat of the message-it
	contains the requested object itself (represented by data data data data
	data ...). The status line has three fields: the protocol version field, a
	status code, and a corresponding status message. In this example, the
	status line indicates that the server is using HTTP/1.1 and that everything
	is OK (that is, the server has found, and is sending, the requested
	object).
</p>
<p>
	The server uses the Connection: close header line to tell the client that
	it is going to close the TCP connection after sending the message.
</p>
<p>
	The Date: header line indicates the time and date when the HTTP response
	was created and sent by the server. Note that this is not the time when the
	object was created or last modified; it is the time when the server
	retrieves the object from its file system, inserts the object into the
	response message, and sends the response message.
</p>
<p>
	The Server: header line indicates that the message was generated by an
	Apache Web server; it is analogous to the User-agent: header line in the
	HTTP request message.
</p>
<p>
	The Last-Modified: header line indicates the time and date when the object
	was created or last modified. The Last-Modified: header, which we will soon
	cover in more detail, is critical for object caching, both in the local
	client and in network cache servers (also known as proxy servers).
</p>
<p>
	The Content-Length: header line indicates the number of bytes in the object
	being sent. The Content-Type: header line indicates that the object in the
	entity body is HTML text. (The object type is officially indicated by the
	Content-Type: header and not by the file extension.)

alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/><br/></center>
<p align="center">
	Fig: General format of an HTTP response message
</p>
<p>
	This general format of the response message matches the previous example of
	a response message. Let's say a few additional words about status codes and
	their phrases. The status code and associated phrase indicate the result of
	the request. Some common status codes and associated phrases include:
</p>
<p>
	i. 200 OK: Request succeeded and the information is returned in the
	response.
</p>
<p>
	ii. 301 Moved Permanently: Requested object has been permanently moved; the
	new URL is specified in Location: header of the response message. The
	client software will automatically retrieve the new URL.
</p>
<p>
	iii. 400 Bad Request: This is a generic error code indicating that the
	request could not be understood by the server.
</p>
<p>
	iv. 404 Not Found: The requested document does not exist on this server.
</p>
<p>
	v. 505 HTTP Version Not Supported: The requested HTTP protocol version is
	not supported by the server.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 13<h1>Explain FTP with its commands and replies. (8-Marks) (2a)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	In a typical FTP session, the user is sitting in front of one host (the
	local host) and wants to transfer files to or from a remote host. In order
	for the user to access the remote account, the user must provide a user
	identification and a password. After providing this authorization
	information, the user can transfer files from the local file system to the
	remote file system and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
	As shown in the below Figure, the user interacts with FTP through an FTP
	user agent. The user first provides the hostname of the remote host,
	causing the FTP client process in the local host to establish a TCP
	connection with the FTP server process in the remote host. The user then
	provides the user identification and password, which are sent over the TCP
	connection as part of FTP commands. Once the server has authorized the
	user, the user copies one or more files stored in the local file system
	into the remote file system (or vice versa).

<p align="center">
	Fig: Control and data connections.
</p>
<p>
	HTTP and FTP are both file transfer protocols and have many common
	characteristics; for example, they both run on top of TCP. However, the two
	application-layer protocols have some important differences. The most
	striking difference is that FTP uses two parallel TCP connections to
transfer a file, a	<strong>control connection and a data connection.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The control connection is used for sending control information between the
	two hosts-information such as user identification, password, commands to
	change remote directory, and commands to "put" and "get" files. The data
	connection is used to actually send a file. Because FTP uses a separate
	control connection, FTP is said to send its control information
	out-of-band. HTTP, as you recall, sends request and response header lines
	into the same TCP connection that carries the transferred file itself. For
	this reason, HTTP is said to send its control information in-band.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>FTP Commands and Replies:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The commands, from client to server, and replies, from server to client,
	are sent across the control connection in 7-bit ASCII format. Thus, like
	HTTP commands, FTP commands are readable by people. In order to delineate
	successive commands, a carriage return and line feed end each command. Each
	command consists of four uppercase ASCII characters, some with optional
	arguments. Some of the more common commands are given below:
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong>USER username:</strong> Used to send the user identification to
	the server.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong>PASS password:</strong> Used to send the user password to the
	server.
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong>LIST:</strong> Used to ask the server to send back a list of
	all the files in the current remote directory. The list of files is sent
	over a (new and non-persistent) data connection rather than the control TCP
	connection.
</p>
<p>
	iv. <strong>RETR filename:</strong> Used to retrieve (that is, get) a file
	from the current directory of the remote host. This command causes the
	remote host to initiate a data connection and to send the requested file
	over the data connection.
</p>
<p>
	v. <strong>STOR filename:</strong> Used to store (that is, put) a file into
	the current directory of the remote host.
</p>
<p>
	There is typically a one-to-one correspondence between the command that the
	user issues and the FTP command sent across the control connection. Each
	command is followed by a reply, sent from server to client. The replies are
	three-digit numbers, with an optional message following the number. This is
	similar in structure to the status code and phrase in the status line of
	the HTTP response message. Some typical replies, along with their possible
	messages, are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	i. 331 Username OK, password required
</p>
<p>
	ii. 125 Data connection already open; transfer starting
</p>
<p>
	iii. 425 Can't open data connection
</p>
<p>
	iv. 452 Error writing file
</p>
<p>
	Readers who are interested in learning about the other FTP commands and
	replies are encouraged to read RFC 959.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 15<h1>Explain DNS resource record. (4-Marks) (2c)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	The DNS servers that together implement the DNS distributed database store
	resource records (RRs), including RRs that provide hostname-to-IP address
	mappings. Each DNS reply message carries one or more resource records. In
	this and the following subsection, we provide a brief overview of DNS
	resource records and messages; more details can be found in [Abitz 1993] or
	in the DNS RFCs [RFC 1034; RFC 1035].
</p>
<p>
	A resource record is a four-tuple that contains the following fields:
</p>
<p>
	(Name, Value, Type, TTL)
</p>
<p>
	TTL is the time to live of the resource record; it determines when a
	resource should be removed from a cache. In the example records given
	below, we ignore the TTL field. The meaning of Name and Value depend on
	Type:
</p>
<p>
	a. If Type=A, then Name is a hostname and Value is the IP address for the
	hostname. Thus, a Type A record provides the standard hostname-to-IP
	address mapping. As an example, (relay1.bar.foo.com, 145.37.93.126, A) is a
	Type A record.
</p>
<p>
	b. If Type=NS, then Name is a domain (such as foo.com) and Value is the
	hostname of an authoritative DNS server that knows how to obtain the IP
	addresses for hosts in the domain. This record is used to route DNS queries
	further along in the query chain. As an example, (foo.com, dns.foo.com, NS)
	is a Type NS record.
</p>
<p>
	c. If Type=CNAME, then Value is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname
	Name. This record can provide querying hosts the canonical name for a
	hostname. As an example, (foo.com, relay1.bar.foo.com, CNAME) is a CNAME
	record.
</p>
<p>
	d. If Type=MX, then Value is the canonical name of a mail server that has
	an alias hostname Name. As an example, (foo.com, mail.bar.foo.com, MX) is
	an MX record. MX records allow the hostnames of mail servers to have simple
	aliases. Note that by using the MX record, a company can have the same
	aliased name for its mail server and for one of its other servers (such as
	its Web server). To obtain the canonical name for the mail server, a DNS
	client would query for an MX record; to obtain the canonical name for the
	other server, the DNS client would query for the CNAME record.
</p>
<p>
	If a DNS server is authoritative for a particular hostname, then the DNS
	server will contain a Type A record for the hostname. (Even if the DNS
	server is not authoritative, it may contain a Type A record in its cache.)
	If a server is not authoritative for a hostname, then the server will
	contain a Type NS record for the domain that includes the hostname; it will
	also contain a Type A record that provides the IP address of the DNS server
	in the Value field of the NS record. As an example, suppose an edu TLD
	server is not authoritative for the host gaia.cs.umass.edu. Then this
	server will contain a record for a domain that includes the host
	gaia.cs.umass.edu, for example, (umass.edu, dns.umass.edu, NS). The edu TLD
	server would also contain a Type A record, which maps the DNS server
	dns.umass.edu to an IP address, for example, (dns.umass.edu,
	128.119.40.111, A).
