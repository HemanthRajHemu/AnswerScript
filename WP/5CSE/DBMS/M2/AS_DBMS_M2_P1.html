			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript1')">Question 1<h1>Describe the characteristics of relations with suitable example for each. (8-Marks) (3a)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	The characteristics of relations are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1 Ordering of Tuples in a Relation:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	A relation is defined as a set of tuples. Mathematically, elements of a set
	have no order among them; hence, tuples in a relation do not have any
	particular order.
</p>
<p>
	In other words, a relation is not sensitive to the ordering of tuples.
	However, in a file, records are physically stored on disk (or in memory),
	so there always is an order among the records.
</p>
<p>
	This ordering indicates first, second, ith, and last records in the file.
	Similarly, when we display a relation as a table, the rows are displayed in
	a certain order.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>
		1.2 Ordering of Values within a Tuple and an Alternative Definition of
		a Relation:
	</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	According to the preceding definition of a relation, an n-tuple is an
	ordered list of n values, so the ordering of values in a tuple-and hence of
	attributes in a relation schema-is important.
</p>
<p>
	However, at a more abstract level, the order of attributes and their values
	is not that important as long as the correspondence between attributes and
	values is maintained.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.3 Values and NULLs in the Tuples:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Each value in a tuple is an atomic value; that is, it is not divisible into
	components within the framework of the basic relational model.
</p>
<p>
	Hence, composite and multivalued attributes are not allowed. This model is
	sometimes called <strong><h2>the flat relational model</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Much of the theory behind the relational model was developed with this
	assumption in mind, which is called the first normal form assumption.
</p>
<p>
	Hence, multivalued attributes must be represented by separate relations,
	and composite attributes are represented only by their simple component
	attributes in the basic relational model.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.4 Interpretation (Meaning) of a Relation:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Each relation can be viewed as a predicate and each tuple in that relation
	can be viewed as an assertion for which that predicate is satisfied (i.e.,
	has value true) for the combination of values in it. In other words, each
	tuple represents a fact.
</p>
<p>
	In general, a student entity has a Name, Ssn, Home_phone, Address,
	Office_phone, Age, and Gpa. Each tuple in the relation can then be
	interpreted as a fact or a particular instance of the assertion.
</p>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>What are the basic operations that can change the states of relations in the database? Explain how the basic operations deal with constraint violations. (8-Marks) (3b)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	There are three basic operations that can change the states of relations in
	the database: Insert, Delete, and Update (or Modify).
</p>
<p>
	They insert new data, delete old data, or modify existing data records,
	respectively.
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong><h2>Insert </h2></strong>is used to insert one or more new tuples in a
	relation,
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong><h2>Delete</h2></strong> is used to delete tuples, and
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong><h2>Update</h2></strong> (or Modify) is used to change the values of
	some attributes in existing tuples.
</p>
<p>
	Whenever these operations are applied, the integrity constraints specified
	on the relational database schema should not be violated.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>2.1 The Insert Operation</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Insert operation provides a list of attribute values for a new tuple t
	that is to be inserted into a relation R. Insert can violate any of the
	four types of constraints. Domain constraints can be violated if an
	attribute value is given that does not appear in the corresponding domain
	or is not of the appropriate data type.
</p>
<p>
	Key constraints can be violated if a key value in the new tuple t already
	exists in another tuple in the relation r(R). Entity integrity can be
	violated if any part of the primary key of the new tuple t is NULL.
	Referential integrity can be violated if the value of any foreign key in t
	refers to a tuple that does not exist in the referenced relation. Here are
	some examples to illustrate this discussion.
</p>
<p>
	i. Operation: Insert into EMPLOYEE. Result: This insertion violates the
	entity integrity constraint (NULL for the primary key Ssn), so it is
	rejected.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Operation: Insert into EMPLOYEE. Result: This insertion violates the
	key constraint because another tuple with the same Ssn value already exists
	in the EMPLOYEE relation, and so it is rejected.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Operation: Insert into EMPLOYEE. Result: This insertion violates the
	referential integrity constraint specified on Dno in EMPLOYEE because no
	corresponding referenced tuple exists in DEPARTMENT with Dnumber = 7.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>2.2 The Delete Operation</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Delete operation can violate only referential integrity. This occurs if
	the tuple being deleted is referenced by foreign keys from other tuples in
	the database. To specify deletion, a condition on the attributes of the
	relation selects the tuple (or tuples) to be deleted. Here are some
	examples.
</p>
<p>
	i. Operation: Delete the WORKS_ON tuple with Essn = '999887777' and Pno =
	10. Result: This deletion is acceptable and deletes exactly one tuple.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Operation: Delete the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = '999887777'. Result:
	This deletion is not acceptable, because there are tuples in WORKS_ON that
	refer to this tuple. Hence, if the tuple in EMPLOYEE is deleted,
	referential integrity violations will result.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Operation: Delete the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = '333445555'. Result:
	This deletion will result in even worse referential integrity violations,
	because the tuple involved is referenced by tuples from the EMPLOYEE,
	DEPARTMENT, WORKS_ON, and DEPENDENT relations.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>2.3 The Update Operation</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Update (or Modify) operation is used to change the values of one or
	more attributes in a tuple (or tuples) of some relation R. It is necessary
	to specify a condition on the attributes of the relation to select the
	tuple (or tuples) to be modified. Here are some examples.
</p>
<p>
	i. Operation: Update the salary of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn =
	'999887777' to 28000. Result: Acceptable.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Operation: Update the Dno of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = '999887777'
	to 1. Result: Acceptable.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Operation: Update the Dno of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = '999887777'
	to 7. Result: Unacceptable, because it violates referential integrity.
</p>
<p>
	iv. Operation: Update the Ssn of the EMPLOYEE tuple with Ssn = '999887777'
	to '987654321'. Result: Unacceptable, because it violates primary key
	constraint by repeating a value that already exists as a primary key in
	another tuple; it violates referential integrity constraints because there
	are other relations that refer to the existing value of Ssn.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 4<h1>In SQL which command is used for table creation? Explain how constraints are specified in SQL during table creation with suitable example. (6-Marks) (4b)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	The basic constraints that can be specified in SQL as part of table
	creation. These include key and referential integrity constraints,
	restrictions on attribute domains and NULLs, and constraints on individual
	tuples within a relation using the CHECK clause.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>
		4.1 Specifying Attribute Constraints and Attribute Defaults:
	</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Because SQL allows NULLs as attribute values, a constraint NOT NULL may be
	specified if NULL is not permitted for a particular attribute. This is
	always implicitly specified for the attributes that are part of the primary
	key of each relation, but it can be specified for any other attributes
	whose values are required not to be NULL.
</p>
<p>
	It is also possible to define a default value for an attribute by appending
	the clause DEFAULT to an attribute definition. The default value is
	included in any new tuple if an explicit value is not provided for that
	attribute.
</p>
<p>
	Figure 4.1 illustrates an example of specifying a default manager for a new
	department and a default department for a new employee. If no default
	clause is specified, the default default value is NULL for attributes that
	do not have the NOT NULL constraint.
</p>
<p>
	Another type of constraint can restrict attribute or domain values using
	the CHECK clause following an attribute or domain definition.6 For example,
	suppose that department numbers are restricted to integer numbers between 1
	and 20; then, we can change the attribute declaration of Dnumber in the
	DEPARTMENT table (see Figure 6.1) to the following:
</p>
<p>
	<em>Dnumber INT NOT NULL CHECK (Dnumber &gt; 0 AND Dnumber &lt; 21); </em>
</p>
<p>
	The CHECK clause can also be used in conjunction with the CREATE DOMAIN
	statement. For example, we can write the following statement:
</p>
<p>
	<em>
		CREATE DOMAIN D_NUM AS INTEGER CHECK (D_NUM &gt; 0 AND D_NUM &lt; 21);
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>4.2 Specifying Key and Referential Integrity Constraints</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Because keys and referential integrity constraints are very important,
	there are special clauses within the CREATE TABLE statement to specify
	them. Some examples to illustrate the specification of keys and referential
	integrity.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>PRIMARY KEY</h2></strong> clause specifies one or more attributes
	that make up the primary key of a relation. If a primary key has a single
	attribute, the clause can follow the attribute directly. For example, the
	primary key of DEPARTMENT can be specified as follows
</p>
<p>
	<em>Dnumber INT PRIMARY KEY</em>
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>UNIQUE</h2></strong> clause specifies alternate (unique) keys, also
	known as candidate keys as illustrated in the DEPARTMENT and PROJECT table
	declarations. The <strong><h2>UNIQUE clause</h2></strong> can also be specified
	directly for a unique key if it is a single attribute, as in the following
	example:
</p>
<p>
	<em>Dname VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE</em>
</p>
<p>
	A referential integrity constraint can be violated when tuples are inserted
	or deleted, or when a foreign key or primary key attribute value is
	updated. The default action that SQL takes for an integrity violation is to
	reject the update operation that will cause a violation, which is known as
	the RESTRICT option.
</p>
<p>
	However, the schema designer can specify an alternative action to be taken
	by attaching a <strong><h2>referential triggered action</h2></strong> clause to any
	foreign key constraint.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>4.3 Giving Names to Constraints</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Figure 4.1 also illustrates how a constraint may be given a constraint
	name, following the keyword CONSTRAINT. The names of all constraints within
	a particular schema must be unique.
</p>
<p>
	A constraint name is used to identify a particular constraint in case the
	constraint must be dropped later and replaced with another constraint.
</p>
<p>
	Giving names to constraints is optional. It is also possible to temporarily
	defer a constraint until the end of a transaction.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>4.4 Specifying Constraints on Tuples Using CHECK</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In addition to key and referential integrity constraints, which are
	specified by special keywords, other table constraints can be specified
	through additional CHECK clauses at the end of a CREATE TABLE statement.
</p>
<p>
	These can be called row-based constraints because they apply to each row
	individually and are checked whenever a row is inserted or modified.
</p>
<p>
	<em>CHECK (Dept_create_date &lt;= Mgr_start_date); </em>
</p>
<p>
	The CHECK clause can also be used to specify more general constraints using

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 5<h1>Explain the data types available for attribute specification in SQL. (4-Marks) (3a)</h1>(June/July 2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			
			<p>
	The basic data types available for attributes include numeric, character
	string, bit string, Boolean, date, and time.
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong><h2>Numeric data</h2></strong> types include integer numbers of various
	sizes (INTEGER or INT, and SMALLINT) and floating-point (real) numbers of
	various precision (FLOAT or REAL, and DOUBLE PRECISION). Formatted numbers
	can be declared by using DECIMAL(i, j)-or DEC(i, j) or NUMERIC(i, j)-where
	i, the precision, is the total number of decimal digits and j, the scale,
	is the number of digits after the decimal point. The default for scale is
	zero, and the default for precision is implementation-defined.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong><h2>Character-string</h2></strong> data types are either fixed
	length-CHAR(n) or CHARACTER(n), where n is the number of characters-or
	varying length- VARCHAR(n) or CHAR VARYING(n) or CHARACTER VARYING(n),
	where n is the maximum number of characters. When specifying a literal
	string value, it is placed between single quotation marks (apostrophes),
	and it is case sensitive (a distinction is made between uppercase and
	lowercase).
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong><h2>Bit-string</h2></strong> data types are either of fixed length
	n-BIT(n)-or varying length- BIT VARYING(n), where n is the maximum number
	of bits. The default for n, the length of a character string or bit string,
	is 1. Literal bit strings are placed between single quotes but preceded by
	a B to distinguish them from character strings; for example, B'10101'.
</p>
<p>
	iv. <strong><h2>A Boolean</h2></strong> data type has the traditional values of TRUE
	or FALSE. In SQL, because of the presence of NULL values, a three-valued
	logic is used, so a third possible value for a Boolean data type is
	UNKNOWN.
</p>
<p>
	v. <strong><h2>The DATE</h2></strong> data type has ten positions, and its
	components are YEAR, MONTH, and DAY in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The TIME data
	type has at least eight positions, with the components HOUR, MINUTE, and
	SECOND in the form HH:MM:SS. Only valid dates and times should be allowed
	by the SQL implementation. This implies that months should be between 1 and
	12 and days must be between 01 and 31; furthermore, a day should be a valid
	day for the corresponding month. The &lt; (less than) comparison can be
	used with dates or times-an earlier date is considered to be smaller than a
	later date, and similarly with time. Literal values are represented by
	single-quoted strings preceded by the keyword DATE or TIME.
