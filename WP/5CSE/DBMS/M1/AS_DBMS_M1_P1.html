			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript1')">Question 1<h1>Explain the main characteristics of the database approach versus the file processing approach. (8-Marks) (1a)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">

			<p>
	The main characteristics of the database approach versus the
	file-processing approach are the following:
</p>
<p>
	i. Self-describing nature of a database system
</p>
<p>
	ii. Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction
</p>
<p>
	iii. Support of multiple views of the data
</p>
<p>
	iv. Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2> I. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>SELF DESCRIBING NATURE OF DATABASE SYSTEM:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	A fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that the database
	system contains not only the database itself but also a complete definition
	or description of the database <strong><h2>structure and constraints</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	This definition is stored in the DBMS catalog, which contains information
	such as the structure of each file, the type and storage format of each
	data item, and various constraints on the data. The information stored in
the catalog is called <strong><h2>meta-data</h2></strong>, and it	<strong><h2>describes the structure</h2></strong> of the primary database.
</p>
<p>
	It is important to note that some newer types of database systems, known as
NOSQL systems, do not require meta-data. Rather the data is stored as	<strong><h2>self-describing data</h2></strong> that includes the data item names and
	data values together in <strong><h2>one structure</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	In <strong><h2>traditional file processing</h2></strong>, data definition is
	typically part of the <strong><h2>application programs</h2></strong> themselves.
	Hence, these programs are constrained to work with only one specific
	database, whose structure is declared in the application programs. For
example, an application program written in C++ may have	<strong><h2>struct or class</h2></strong> declarations. Whereas file-processing
	software can <strong><h2>access only specific databases</h2></strong>, DBMS software
	can access diverse databases by extracting the database definitions from
	the catalog and using these definitions.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>II. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>
		INSULATION BETWEEN PROGRAMS AND DATA, AND DATA ABSTRACTION:
	</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in
	the application programs, so any changes to the structure of a file may
	require <strong><h2>changing all programs</h2></strong> that access that file.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require such changes in most
	cases. The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS catalog separately
from the access programs. We call this property	<strong><h2>program-data independence.</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	For example, a file access program may be written in such a way that it can
	access only STUDENT records of the structure. If we want to add another
	piece of data to each STUDENT record, say the Birth_date, such a program
	will no longer work and must be changed. By contrast, in a DBMS
	environment, we only need to change the description of STUDENT records in
	the catalog to reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date; no
	programs are changed. The next time a DBMS program refers to the catalog,
	the new structure of STUDENT records will be accessed and used.
</p>
<p>
	User application programs can operate on the data by invoking the
	operations through their names and arguments, regardless of how the
operations are implemented. This may be termed	<strong><h2>program-operation independence</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	The characteristic that allows program-data independence and
	program-operation independence is called <strong><h2>data abstraction</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	A DBMS provides users with a <strong><h2>conceptual representation</h2></strong> of
	data that does not include many of the details of how the data is stored or
	how the operations are implemented.
</p>
<p>
	Informally, a data model is a type of data abstraction that is used to
	provide this conceptual representation.
</p>
<p>
	The data model uses logical concepts, such as objects, their properties,
	and their interrelationships, that may be easier for most users to
understand than computer storage concepts. Hence, the data model	<strong><h2>hides storage and implementation details</h2></strong> that are not of
	interest to most database users.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>III. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>SUPPORT OF MULTIPLE VIEWS OF THE DATA:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	A database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a
	different perspective or <strong><h2>view </h2></strong>of the database.
</p>
<p>
	A view may be a subset of the database or it may contain virtual data that
	is derived from the database files but is not explicitly stored. Some users
	may not need to be aware of whether the data they refer to is stored or
	derived.
</p>
<p>
	A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must
	provide facilities for defining multiple views.
</p>
<p>
	For example, one user of the database may be interested only in accessing
	and printing the transcript of each student. A second user, who is
	interested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites
of each course for which the student registers, may require the view.	<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>IV. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>SHARING OF DATA AND MULTIUSER TRANSACTION PROCESSING:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access
	the database at the same time. This is essential if data for multiple
	applications is to be integrated and maintained in a single database.
</p>
<p>
	The DBMS must include <strong><h2>concurrency control</h2></strong> software to
	ensure that several users trying to update the same data do so in a
	controlled manner so that the result of the updates is correct. For
	example, when several reservation agents try to assign a seat on an airline
	flight, the DBMS should ensure that each seat can be accessed by only one
	agent at a time for assignment to a passenger.
</p>
<p>
These types of applications are generally called	<strong><h2>online transaction processing (OLTP) applications</h2></strong>. A
	fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent
	transactions operate correctly and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
	The concept of a transaction has become central to many database
	applications. A transaction is an executing program or process that
	includes one or more database accesses, such as reading or updating of
	database records.
</p>
<p>
Each transaction is supposed to execute a	<strong><h2>logically correct database</h2></strong> access if executed in its
	entirety without interference from other transactions.
</p>
<p>
The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties. The	<strong><h2>isolation property</h2></strong> ensures that each transaction appears
	to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of
	transactions may be executing concurrently.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>atomicity property</h2></strong> ensures that either all the
	database operations in a transaction are executed or none are.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">

	<strong><h2>2.1 THREE-SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The goal of the three-schema architecture, illustrated in Figure 2.1, is to
	separate the user applications from the physical database. In this
architecture, schemas can be defined at the following three levels:	<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2> i. </h2></strong>
	The <strong><h2>internal level</h2></strong> has an <strong><h2>internal schema</h2></strong>
	, which describes the physical storage structure of the database. The
	internal schema uses a physical data model and describes the complete
	details of data storage and access paths for the database.<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2> ii. </h2></strong>
	The <strong><h2>conceptual level</h2></strong> has a conceptual schema, which
	describes the structure of the whole database for a community of users. The
	conceptual schema hides the details of physical storage structures and
	concentrates on describing entities, data types, relationships, user
	operations, and constraints. Usually, a representational data model is used
	to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented.
This implementation <strong><h2>conceptual schema</h2></strong> is often based on a<strong><h2>conceptual schema design</h2></strong> in a high-level data model.	<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>iii. </h2></strong>
	The <strong><h2>external or view level</h2></strong> includes a number of external
	schemas or user views. Each external schema describes the part of the
	database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest
	of the database from that user group. As in the previous level, each
	external schema is typically implemented using a representational data
	model, possibly based on <strong><h2>an external schema</h2></strong> design in a
	high-level conceptual data model.<strong><h2></h2></strong>

<p align="center">
	Fig 2.1: Three-Schema Architecture
</p>
<p>
	The three-schema architecture is a convenient tool with which the user can
	visualize the schema levels in a database system. Most DBMSs do not
	separate the three levels completely and explicitly, but they support the
	three-schema architecture to some extent. Some older DBMSs may include
	physical-level details in the conceptual schema.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>2.2 Mapping - Three-Schema Architecture</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In the three-schema architecture, each user group refers to its own
	external schema. Hence, the DBMS must transform a request specified on an
	external schema into a request against the conceptual schema, and then into
	a request on the internal schema for processing over the stored database.
</p>
<p>
	If the request is a database retrieval, the data extracted from the stored
	database must be reformatted to match the user's external view. The
processes of transforming requests and results between levels are called	<strong><h2>mappings</h2></strong>.<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	These mappings may be time-consuming, so some DBMSs-especially those that
	are meant to support small databases-do not support external views. Even in
	such systems, however, it is necessary to transform requests between the
	conceptual and internal levels.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>2.3 Schema Definition language support</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In current DBMSs, the preceding types of languages are usually not
	considered distinct languages; rather, a comprehensive integrated language
	is used that includes constructs for conceptual schema definition, view
	definition, and data manipulation.<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Storage definition is typically kept separate, since it is used for
	defining physical storage structures to fine-tune the performance of the
	database system, which is usually done by the DBA staff.<strong><h2></h2></strong>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>Discuss with examples, different types of architectures. (7-Marks) (2a)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	The different types of Architecture are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1.1 </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Centralized DBMSs Architecture:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The reason was that in older systems, most users accessed the DBMS via
	computer terminals that did not have processing power and only provided
	display capabilities. Therefore, all processing was performed remotely on
	the computer system housing the DBMS, and only display information and
	controls were sent from the computer to the display terminals, which were
	connected to the central computer via various types of communications
	networks.
</p>
<p>
	As prices of hardware declined, most users replaced their terminals with
	PCs and workstations, and more recently with mobile devices. At first,
	database systems used these computers similarly to how they had used
	display terminals, so that the DBMS itself was still a centralized DBMS in
	which all the DBMS functionality, application program execution, and user
	interface processing were carried out on one machine.
</p>
<p>
	Figure 3.1 illustrates the physical components in a centralized
	architecture. Gradually, DBMS systems started to exploit the available
	processing power at the user side, which led to client/server DBMS
	architectures.
</p>

<p align="center">
	Fig 3.1: A physical centralized architecture
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1.2 </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Basic Client/Server Architectures:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>client/server architecture</h2></strong> was developed to deal with
	computing environments in which a large number of PCs, workstations, file
	servers, printers, database servers, Web servers, e-mail servers, and other
	software and equipment are connected via a network.
</p>
<p>
	The idea is to define specialized servers with specific functionalities.
	For example, it is possible to connect a number of PCs or small
	workstations as clients to a file server that maintains the files of the
	client machines. Another machine can be designated as a printer server by
	being connected to various printers; all print requests by the clients are
	forwarded to this machine. Web servers or e-mail servers also fall into the
	specialized server category
</p>
<p>
	The resources provided by specialized servers can be accessed by many
	client machines. The client machines provide the user with the appropriate
	interfaces to utilize these servers, as well as with local processing power
	to run local applications. This concept can be carried over to other
	software packages, with specialized programs-such as a CAD (computer-aided
	design) package-being stored on specific server machines and being made
	accessible to multiple clients.
</p>
<p>
	Fig 3.3 illustrates client/server architecture at the logical level; Figure
	3.4 is a simplified diagram that shows the physical architecture. Some
	machines would be client sites only (for example, mobile devices or
	workstations/PCs that have only client software installed). Other machines
	would be dedicated servers, and others would have both client and server
	functionality.
</p>
<p>
	The concept of client/server architecture assumes an underlying framework
	that consists of many PCs/workstations and mobile devices as well as a
	smaller number of server machines, connected via wireless networks or LANs
	and other types of computer networks.

</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1.3 </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Two-Tier Client/Server Architectures for DBMS:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In relational database management systems (RDBMSs), many of which started
	as centralized systems, the system components that were first moved to the
	client side were the user interface and application programs. Because SQL
	provided a standard language for RDBMSs, this created a logical dividing
	point between client and server.
</p>
<p>
	Hence, the query and transaction functionality related to SQL processing
	remained on the server side. In such an architecture, the server is often
	called a query server or transaction server because it provides these two
	functionalities. In an RDBMS, the server is also often called an SQL
	server.
</p>
<p>
	The user interface programs and application programs can run on the client
	side. When DBMS access is required, the program establishes a connection to
	the DBMS (which is on the server side); once the connection is created, the
	client program can communicate with the DBMS.
</p>
<p>
	A standard called Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provides an application
	programming interface (API), which allows client-side programs to call the
	DBMS, as long as both client and server machines have the necessary
	software installed.
</p>
<p>
	A client program can actually connect to several RDBMSs and send query and
	transaction requests using the ODBC API, which are then processed at the
	server sites.
</p>
<p>
	The architectures described here are called two-tier architectures because
	the software components are distributed over two systems: client and
	server. The advantages of this architecture are its simplicity and seamless
	compatibility with existing systems. The emergence of the Web changed the
	roles of clients and servers, leading to the three-tier architecture.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1.4 </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Three-Tier and n-Tier Architectures for Web Applications:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Many Web applications use an architecture called the three-tier
	architecture, which adds an intermediate layer between the client and the
	database server. This is demonstrated in Fig 3.5
</p>
<p>
	This intermediate layer or middle tier is called the application server or
	the Web server, depending on the application. This server plays an
	intermediary role by running application programs and storing business
	rules (procedures or constraints) that are used to access data from the
	database server.
</p>
<p>
	It can also improve database security by checking a client's credentials
	before forwarding a request to the database server

<p>
	Clients contain user interfaces and Web browsers.
</p>
<p>
	The intermediate server accepts requests from the client, processes the
	request and sends database queries and commands to the database server, and
	then acts as a conduit for passing (partially) processed data from the
	database server to the clients, where it may be processed further and
	filtered to be presented to the users.
</p>
<p>
	The bottom layer includes all data management services. The middle layer
	can also act as a Web server, which retrieves query results from the
	database server and formats them into dynamic Web pages that are viewed by
	the Web browser at the client side. The client machine is typically a PC or
	mobile device connected to the Web.
</p>
<p>
	Advances in encryption and decryption technology make it safer to transfer
	sensitive data from server to client in encrypted form, where it will be
	decrypted. The latter can be done by the hardware or by advanced software.
</p>
<p>
	This technology gives higher levels of data security, but the network
	security issues remain a major concern. Various technologies for data
	compression also help to transfer large amounts of data from servers to
	clients over wired and wireless networks.
