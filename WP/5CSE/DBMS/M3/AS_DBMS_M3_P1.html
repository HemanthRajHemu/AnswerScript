			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>Define Stored Procedure, Explain the creating and calling of stored procedure with suitable example. (8-Marks) (6a)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	2.1 Definition
</p>
<p>
	A <strong><h2>stored procedure</h2></strong> is a program that is executed through a
	single SQL statement that can be locally executed and completed within the
	process space of the database server. The results can be packaged into one
	big result and returned to the application, or the application logic can be
	performed directly at the server, without having to transmit the results to
	the client at all.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Stored procedures</h2></strong>
	are also beneficial for software engineering reasons. Once a stored
	procedure is registered with the database server, different users can
	re-use the stored procedure, eliminating duplication of efforts in writing
	SQL queries or application logic, and making code maintenance easy.
</p>
<p>
	2.2 Creating a Simple Stored Procedure
</p>
<p>
	We see that stored procedures must have a name; this stored procedure has
	the name 'ShowNumberOfOrders.' Otherwise, it just contains an SQL statement
	that is precompiled and stored at the server.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/2.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p align="center">
	Fig 2.1: A Stored Procedure in SQL
</p>
<p>
	Stored procedures can also have parameters. These parameters have to be
	valid SQL types, and have one of three different modes: IN, OUT, or INOUT.
	IN parameters are arguments to' the stored procedure. OUT parameters are
	returned from the stored procedure; it assigns values to all OUT parameters
	that the user can process. INOUT parameters combine the properties of IN
	and OUT parameters: They contain values to be passed to the stored
	procedures, and the stored procedure can set their values as return values.
	Stored procedures enforce strict type conformance: If a parameter is of
	type INTEGER, it cannot be called with an argument of type VARCHAR.
</p>
<p>
	Let us look at an example of a stored procedure with arguments. The stored
	procedure shown in Figure 2.1 has two arguments: book_isbn and addedQty. It
	updates the available number of copies of a book with the quantity from a
	new shipment.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/2.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p align="center">
	Fig 2.2: A Stored Procedure with Arguments
</p>
<p>
	Stored procedures do not have to be written in SQL; they can be written in
	any host language. As an example, the stored procedure shown in Figure 0.10
	is a Java function that is dynamically executed by the database server
	whenever it is called by the client.
</p>
<p>
	2.3 Calling Stored Procedures
</p>
<p>
	Stored procedures can be called in interactive SQL with the CALL statement:
</p>

<p align="center">
	Fig 2.3: A Stored Procedure in Java
</p>
<p>
	CALL storedProcedureName(argumentl, argument2, ... , argumentN);
</p>
<p>
	In Embedded SQL, the arguments to a stored procedure are usually variables
	in the host language. For example, the stored procedure AddInventory would
	be called as follows:

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>Explain the Single - tier and Client - Server architecture, with a neat diagram. (8-Marks) (6b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			<p>
	In this section, we provide some perspective on the three-tier architecture
	by discussing single-tier and client-server architectures, the predecessors
	of the three-tier architecture.
</p>
<p>
	Initially, data-intensive applications were combined into a single tier,
	including the DBMS, application logic, and user interface, a" illustrated
	in Figure 3.1. The application typically ran on a mainframe, and users
	accessed it through <strong><h2><em>dumb teT'minals</em></h2></strong> that could
	perform only data input and display. This approach has the benefit of being
	easily maintained by a central administrator.

</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/3.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p align="center">
	Fig 3.2: A Two-Server Architecture: Thin Clients
</p>
<p>
	Single-tier architectures have an important drawback: Users expect
	graphical interfaces that require much more computational power than simple
	dumb terminals. Centralized computation of the graphical displays of such
	interfaces requires much more computational power than a single server has
	available, and thus single-tier architectures do not scale to thousands of
	users. The commoditization of the PC and the availability of cheap client
	computers led to the development of the two-tier architecture.
</p>
<p>
	Two-tier architectures, often also referred to as; client-server
	architectures, consist of a client computer and a server computer, which
	interact through a well-defined protocol. What part of the functionality
	the client implements, and what part is left to the server, can vary. In
	the traditional client-server architecture, the client implements just the
	graphical user interface, and the server. implements both the business
	logic and the data management; such clients are often called thin clients,
	and this architecture is illustrated in Figure 3.2.

iv)	Views and their updatability<br/>

			</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	<strong><h2>i) </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Nested Queries</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Answer:
</p>
<p>
	Some queries require that existing values in the database be fetched and
	then used in a comparison condition. Such queries can be conveniently
	formulated by using <strong><h2>nested queries</h2></strong>, which are complete
	select-from-where blocks within another SQL query. That other query is
	called the <strong><h2>outer query</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	These nested queries can also appear in the WHERE clause or the FROM clause
	or the SELECT clause or other SQL clauses as needed.
</p>
<p>
	In Q4A, the first nested query selects the project numbers of projects that
	have an employee with last name 'Smith' involved as manager, whereas the
	second nested query selects the project numbers of projects that have an
	employee with last name 'Smith' involved as worker. In the outer query, we
	use the OR logical connective to retrieve a PROJECT tuple if the PNUMBER
	value of that tuple is in the result of either nested query.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/4.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
</p>
<p>
	If a nested query returns a single attribute and a single tuple, the query
	result will be a single (scalar) value. In such cases, it is permissible to
	use = instead of IN for the comparison operator. In general, the nested
	query will return a table (relation), which is a set or multiset of tuples.
</p>
<p>
	SQL allows the use of tuples of values in comparisons by placing them
	within parentheses. To illustrate this, consider the following query:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/4.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>ii) </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Aggregate functions</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Answer:
</p>
<p>
	Aggregate functions are used to summarize information from multiple tuples
	into a single-tuple summary. Grouping is used to create subgroups of tuples
	before summarization. Grouping and aggregation are required in many
	database applications, and we will introduce their use in SQL through
examples. A number of built-in aggregate functions exist:	<strong><h2>COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, and AVG.</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The COUNT function returns the number of tuples or values as specified in a
	query. The functions SUM, MAX, MIN, and AVG can be applied to a set or
	multiset of numeric values and return, respectively, the sum, maximum
	value, minimum value, and average (mean) of those values.
</p>
<p>
	These functions can be used in the SELECT clause or in a HAVING clause
	(which we introduce later). The functions MAX and MIN can also be used with
	attributes that have nonnumeric domains if the domain values have a total
	ordering among one another.3 We illustrate the use of these functions with
	several queries.
</p>
<p>
	Find the sum of the salaries of all employees, the maximum salary, the
	minimum salary, and the average salary.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/4.3.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
</p>
<p>
	This query returns a single-row summary of all the rows in the EMPLOYEE
	table. We could use AS to rename the column names in the resulting
	single-row table; for example
</p>

alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>iii) </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Triggers</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Answer:
</p>
<p>
	The <strong><h2>CREATE TRIGGER</h2></strong>, which can be used to specify automatic
	actions that the database system will perform when certain events and
	conditions occur. This type of functionality is generally referred to as
	active databases.
</p>
<p>
	Another important statement in SQL is CREATE TRIGGER. In many cases it is
	convenient to specify the type of action to be taken when certain events
	occur and when certain conditions are satisfied. For example, it may be
	useful to specify a condition that, if violated, causes some user to be
	informed of the violation.
</p>
<p>
	A manager may want to be informed if an employee's travel expenses exceed a
	certain limit by receiving a message whenever this occurs. The action that
	the DBMS must take in this case is to send an appropriate message to that
	user.
</p>
<p>
	The condition is thus used to monitor the database. Other actions may be
	specified, such as executing a specific stored procedure or triggering
	other updates. The CREATE TRIGGER statement is used to implement such
	actions in SQL.
</p>
<p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/4.5.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
</p>
<p>
	The trigger is given the name SALARY_VIOLATION, which can be used to remove
	or deactivate the trigger later. A typical trigger which is regarded as an
	ECA (Event, Condition, Action) rule has three components:
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong><h2>The event(s):</h2></strong> These are usually database update
	operations that are explicitly applied to the database. In this example the
	events are: inserting a new employee record, changing an employee's salary,
	or changing an employee's supervisor. The person who writes the trigger
	must make sure that all possible events are accounted for. In some cases,
	it may be necessary to write more than one trigger to cover all possible
	cases. These events are specified after the keyword BEFORE in our example,
	which means that the trigger should be executed before the triggering
	operation is executed. An alternative is to use the keyword AFTER, which
	specifies that the trigger should be executed after the operation specified
	in the event is completed.
</p>
<p>
	ii. The <strong><h2>condition</h2></strong> that determines whether the rule action
	should be executed: Once the triggering event has occurred, an optional
	condition may be evaluated. If no condition is specified, the action will
	be executed once the event occurs. If a condition is specified, it is first
	evaluated, and only if it evaluates to true will the rule action be
	executed. The condition is specified in the WHEN clause of the trigger.
</p>
<p>
	iii. The <strong><h2>action</h2></strong> to be taken: The action is usually a
	sequence of SQL statements, but it could also be a database transaction or
	an external program that will be automatically executed. In this example,
	the action is to execute the stored procedure INFORM_SUPERVISOR.
</p>
<p>
	Triggers can be used in various applications, such as maintaining database
	consistency, monitoring database updates, and updating derived data
	automatically.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>iv) </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Views and their updatability</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Answer:
</p>
<p>
	A view in SQL terminology is a single table that is derived from other
	tables. These other tables can be base tables or previously defined views.
	A <strong><h2>view</h2></strong> does not necessarily exist in physical form; it is
considered to be a <strong><h2>virtual table</h2></strong>, in contrast to	<strong><h2>base tables</h2></strong>, whose tuples are always physically stored in
	the database. This limits the possible update operations that can be
	applied to views, but it does not provide any limitations on querying a
	view.
</p>
<p>
	The command to specify a view is CREATE VIEW. The view is given a (virtual)
	table name (or view name), a list of attribute names, and a query to
	specify the contents of the view. If none of the view attributes results
	from applying functions or arithmetic operations, we do not have to specify
	new attribute names for the view, since they would be the same as the names
	of the attributes of the defining tables in the default case.
</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/4.7.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
</p>
<p align="center">
	Fig 4.7: Two views specified on the database schema
</p>
<p>
	In V1, we did not specify any new attribute names for the view WORKS_ON1
	(although we could have); in this case, WORKS_ON1 inherits the names of the
	view attributes from the defining tables EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, and WORKS_ON.
	View V2 explicitly specifies new attribute names for the view DEPT_INFO,
	using a one-to-one correspondence between the attributes specified in the
	CREATE VIEW clause and those specified in the SELECT clause of the query
	that defines the view.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>a. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>View Implementation, View Update, and Inline Views:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The problem of how a DBMS can efficiently implement a view for efficient
	querying is complex. Two main approaches have been suggested. One strategy,
	called query modification, involves modifying or transforming the view
	query (submitted by the user) into a query on the underlying base tables.
	For example, the query QV1 would be automatically modified to the following
	query by the DBMS.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/DBMS/M3/M3IMG/4.7.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	The disadvantage of this approach is that it is inefficient for views
	defined via complex queries that are time-consuming to execute, especially
	if multiple view queries are going to be applied to the same view within a
	short period of time. The second strategy, called view materialization.
</p>
<p>
	A user can always issue a retrieval query against any view. However,
	issuing an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE command on a view table is in many
	cases not possible. In general, an update on a view defined on a single
	table without any aggregate functions can be mapped to an update on the
	underlying base table under certain conditions.
</p>
<p>
	For a view involving joins, an update operation may be mapped to update
	operations on the underlying base relations in multiple ways. Hence, it is
	often not possible for the DBMS to determine which of the updates is
	intended. To illustrate potential problems with updating a view defined on
	multiple tables, consider the WORKS_ON1 view, and suppose that we issue the
	command to update the PNAME attribute of 'John Smith' from 'ProductX' to
	'ProductY'.

</p>
<p>
	This query can be mapped into several updates on the base relations to give
	the desired update effect on the view. In addition, some of these updates
	will create additional side effects that affect the result of other
	queries. For example, here are two possible updates, (a) and (b), on the
	base relations corresponding to the view update operation.

</p>
<p>
	Update (a) relates 'John Smith' to the 'ProductY' PROJECT tuple instead of
	the 'ProductX' PROJECT tuple and is the most likely desired update.
	However, (b) would also give the desired update effect on the view, but it
	accomplishes this by changing the name of the 'ProductX' tuple in the
	PROJECT relation to 'ProductY'. It is quite unlikely that the user who
	specified the view update UV1 wants the update to be interpreted as in (b),
	since it also has the side effect of changing all the view tuples with
	Pname = 'ProductX'
</p>
<p>
	In summary, we can make the following observations:
</p>
<p>
	A. A view with a single defining table is updatable if the view attributes
	contain the primary key of the base relation, as well as all attributes
	with the NOT NULL constraint that do not have default values specified
</p>
<p>
	B. Views defined on multiple tables using joins are generally not
	updatable.
</p>
<p>
	C. Views defined using grouping and aggregate functions are not updatable.

	<strong><h2>Schema change statements </h2></strong>

<p>
	Answer:
</p>
<p>
	an overview of the schema evolution commands available in SQL, which can be
	used to alter a schema by adding or dropping tables, attributes,
	constraints, and other schema elements. This can be done while the database
	is operational and does not require recompilation of the database schema.
	Certain
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>The DROP Command</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The DROP command can be used to drop named schema elements, such as tables,
	domains, types, or constraints. One can also drop a whole schema if it is
	no longer needed by using the DROP SCHEMA command. There are two drop
	behavior options: CASCADE and RESTRICT. For example, to remove the COMPANY
	database schema and all its tables, domains, and other elements, the
	CASCADE option is used as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<em>DROP SCHEMA COMPANY CASCADE;</em>
</p>
<p>
	If the RESTRICT option is chosen in place of CASCADE, the schema is dropped
	only if it has no elements in it; otherwise, the DROP command will not be
	executed. To use the RESTRICT option, the user must first individually drop
	each element in the schema, then drop the schema itself.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>The ALTER Command</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	The definition of a base table or of other named schema elements can be
	changed by using the ALTER command. For base tables, the possible alter
	table actions include adding or dropping a column (attribute), changing a
	column definition, and adding or dropping table constraints. For example,
	to add an attribute for keeping track of jobs of employees to the EMPLOYEE
	base relation in the COMPANY schema, we can use the command
</p>
<p>
	<em>ALTER TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE ADD COLUMN Job VARCHAR(12);</em>
</p>
<p>
	We must still enter a value for the new attribute Job for each individual
	EMPLOYEE tuple. This can be done either by specifying a default clause or
	by using the UPDATE command individually on each tuple (see Section 6.4.3).
	If no default clause is specified, the new attribute will have NULLs in all
	the tuples of the relation immediately after the command is executed;
	hence, the NOT NULL constraint is not allowed in this case.

	<strong><h2>vi) </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>Group by and having clause</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Answer:
</p>
<p>
	In many cases we want to apply the aggregate functions to subgroups of
	tuples in a relation, where the subgroups are based on some attribute
	values. For example, we may want to find the average salary of employees in
	each department or the number of employees who work on each project. In
	these cases, we need to partition the relation into non-overlapping subsets
	(or groups) of tuples. Each group (partition) will consist of the tuples
	that have the same value of some attribute(s), called the grouping
	attribute(s). We can then apply the function to each such group
	independently to produce summary information about each group.
</p>
<p>
	SQL has a GROUP BY clause for this purpose. The GROUP BY clause specifies
	the grouping attributes, which should also appear in the SELECT clause, so
	that the value resulting from applying each aggregate function to a group
	of tuples appears along with the value of the grouping attribute(s).
</p>
<p>
	For each department, retrieve the department number, the number of
	employees in the department, and their average salary.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	the EMPLOYEE tuples are partitioned into groups-each group having the same
	value for the GROUP BY attribute Dno. Hence, each group contains the
	employees who work in the same department. The COUNT and AVG functions are
	applied to each such group of tuples. Notice that the SELECT clause
	includes only the grouping attribute and the aggregate functions to be
	applied on each group of tuples.
</p>
<p>
	SQL provides a HAVING clause, which can appear in conjunction with a GROUP
	BY clause, for this purpose. HAVING provides a condition on the summary
	information regarding the group of tuples associated with each value of the
	grouping attributes. Only the groups that satisfy the condition are
	retrieved in the result of the query.
</p>
<p>
	For each project on which more than two employees work, retrieve the
	project number, the project name, and the number of employees who work on
	the project.
