			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856-1915) is considered to be the Father of Scientific Management, He exerted a great influence on the development of management thought through his experiments and writings. During his career spanning a period of 26 years, he conducted a series of experiment, in three companies: Midvale Steel, Simonds Rolling Machine and Bethlehem Steel.
			</p><p>While serving as the Chief Engineer of Midvale Steel Company, Taylor made several important contributions which are classified under scientific management.
			</p><p>i.	<b>Time and Motion Study</b>
			</p><p>Since Taylor had been a machinist himself, he knew how piece-work employees used to hold back production to its one-third level because they feared that their employers would cut their Piece rate as soon as there was a rise in production. The real trouble, Taylor thought was that no one knew how much work it was reasonable to expect a man to do. He, therefore, started time and motion study, under which each motion of a job was to be timed with the help of a stop watch and shorter and fewer motions were to be developed. Thus the best way of doing a job was found. This replaced the old rule-of-thumb-knowledge of the workman.
			</p><p>ii.	<b>Differential Payment</b>
			</p><p>Taylor introduced a new payment plan called the differential piece work, in which he linked incentives with production. Under this plan a worker received low piece rate if he produced the standard number of pieces and high rate if he surpassed the standard. Taylor thought that the attraction of high piece rate would motivate workers to increase production.
			</p><p>iii.	<b>Drastic Reorganisation of Supervision</b>
			</p><p>Taylor suggested two new concepts: (i) separation of planning and doing, and (ii) functional foremanship. In those day sit used to be customary for each worker to plan his own work. The worker himself used to select his tools and decide the order in which the operations were to be performed. The fore- man simply told the worker what jobs to perform, not how to do them. Taylor suggested that the work should be planned by a foreman and not by the worker. Further, he said that there should be as many foremen as there are special functions involved in doing a job and each of these foremen should give orders to the worker on his speciality, 
			</p><p>iv.	<b>Scientific Recruitment and Training</b>
			</p><p>Taylor emphasised the need for scientific selection and development of the worker. He said that the management should develop and train every worker to bring out his best faculties and to enable him to do a higher, more interesting and more profitable class of work than he has done in the past.
			</p><p>v.	<b>Intimate Friendly Cooperation between the Management and Workers:</b>
			</p><p>Taylor said that for the above suggestions to succeed, "a complete mental revolution" on the part of management and labour was required. Rather than quarrel over whatever profits there were, they should both try to increase production. By doing so, profits would be increased to such an extent that labour and management would no longer have to compete for them. In short, Taylor believed that management and labour had a common interest in increasing productivity.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')"><h1>7.	With a neat diagram, explain the hierarchy of planning. (8-Marks) (1b) (June / July 2018</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>In a large organisation, there are various types of plans that are arranged in a hierarchy within the organisation. This means that plans at each level have to be consistent with and contribute to the achievement of plans above them.
			</p><center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/IMG/M1/7.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/><br/></center>
			
			<p><b>Vision:</b> At the top of this hierarchy is the vision. This is the dream that an entrepreneur creates about the direction that his business should pursue in future. It describes his aspirations, beliefs and values and shapes organisation's strategy. In fact, visioning is an ongoing process. As the organisation proceeds, the vision reshapes.
			</p><p>A vision should be brief, focused, clear and inspirational to an organisation's employees. It should be linked to customers' needs and convey a general strategy for achieving the mission.
			</p><p><b>Mission:</b> Next comes mission, which is the unique aim of an organisation that sets it apart from others of its type. It is an organisation's specialisation in some area - service, product or client, which decides the organisation's scope of business. Indeed, this may lead to ruling out a customer segment that would simply be unprofitable or too hard to serve, given the organisation's capabilities. Thus, a university may have as its mission imparting education to women only or a hospital may treat heart disorders only.
			</p><p>Like vision, a firm's mission also guides the development of strategies. It establishes the context within which daily operating decisions are made and sets limits on available strategic options. It is, therefore, necessary that it is not revised every now and then in response to every new turn in the economy. But it may change over time to take advantage of new opportunities or respond to new market conditions.
			</p><p><b>Objectives:</b> Objectives are goals or aims that the management wishes the organisation to achieve in pursuit of its mission. These are the end points or pole-star towards which all business activities like organising, staffing, directing and controlling are directed. Only after having defined these end points can the manager determine the kind of organisation, the kind of personnel and their qualifications, the kind of motivation, supervision and direction and the kind of control techniques which he must employing reach these points.
			</p><p>Objectives should be distinguished from the word "purpose", The purpose of an organisation is its, primary role defined by the society in which it operates, For example, the purpose of every university is to impart education or the purpose of every hospital is to provide health care. Purpose is therefore a broad aim that applies not only to a given organisation but to all organisations of its type in that society.
			</p><p><b>Strategies:</b> Strategy is a term originated in military, which connotes a response to a competitive environment. In a competitive situation, it is not enough to build plans logically from goals unless the plans take into account the environmental opportunities and threats and the organisational strengths and weaknesses. This is commonly referred to as SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis.
			</p><hr/><p><b>Operational Plans:</b>
			</p><p>These plans act as means of implementing the organisation's strategy. They provide the details of how the strategy will be accomplished. There are two main types of operational plans: standing plans and single-use plans.
			</p><p>i.	<b>Standing Plans</b>
			</p><p>These plans are designed for situations that recur often enough to justify a standardised approach. For example, it would be inefficient for a bank to develop a new plan for processing a loan application of each new client, Instead, it uses one standing plan that anticipates in advance whether to approve or turn down any request based on the information furnished, credit rating and the like. The major types of standing plans are policies, procedures, methods and rules.
			</p><p>ii.	<b>Single-use Plans:</b>
			</p><p>These plans, as their name suggests, are developed to achieve a specific end; when that end is achieved, the plan is dissolved. The major types of these plans are programmes and budgets.
			</p><p>iii.<b>	Business Plan:</b>
			</p><p>It is an important document prepared by an entrepreneur as a Start-up strategy to prove to private investors, customers, suppliers and distributors that he is in a position to articulate and manage the diverse aspects of his business.

			<p>Although all managers perform the same functions of planning, organising directing, controlling, innovating and representing, there are levels among them. There are in any organisation, the so called <b>First-line, Middle and top managers. </b>
			</p><p>The <b>lower (or first-line) management</b> group is made up of foremen and white collar supervisors, men and women who are only one step above the rank and file. 
			</p><p>Next comes <b>middle management</b>, a vast and diverse group that includes sales managers, plant managers, personnel managers and many other department heads. 
			</p><p>Finally, there is the <b>top management</b> consisting of the board chairman's, the company presidents, the executive vice-presidents, i.e. the men who coordinate all the specialities and make policies for the company as a whole.
