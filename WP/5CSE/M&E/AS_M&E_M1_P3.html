			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>A skill is an individual's ability to perform physical or mental tasks with a specified outcome. Skill is not necessarily inborn. It can be developed through practice and through translating one's knowledge and experience into action.  In order to be able to successfully discharge his roles, a manager should possess three major skills. These are: <b>conceptual skill, human relations skill and technical skill</b>.
			</p><p><b>Conceptual skill</b> deals with ideas, <b>technical skill</b> with things and <b>human skill</b> with people. While both conceptual and technical skills are needed for good decision-making, human skill is necessary for a good leader.
			</p><p>The <b>conceptual skill</b> refers to the ability of a manager to take a broad and farsighted view of the organisation and its future, his ability to think in abstract, his ability to analyse the forces working in a situation, his creative and innovative ability and his ability to assess the environment and the changes taking place in it. 
			</p><p>In short, it is his ability to conceptualise the environment, the organisation, and his own job, so that he can set appropriate goals for his organisation, for himself and for his team. This skill seems to increase in importance as a manager moves up to higher positions of responsibility in the organisation.
			</p><p>The <b>technical skill</b> is the manager's understanding of the nature of job that people under him have to perform. It refers to a person's knowledge and proficiency in any type of process or technique. There are three things a manager must know about technical skills. These are:
			</p><p>(i) Which skills should be employed in his particular enterprise?
			</p><p>(ii) What is the role of each skill employed?
			</p><p>(iii) How are different skills interrelated?
			</p><p><b>Human relations skill</b> is the ability to interact effectively with people at all levels. This skill develops in the manager sufficient ability 
			</p><p>(a) to recognise the feelings and sentiments of others; 
			</p><p>(b) to judge the possible reactions to, and outcomes of various courses of action he may undertake; and 
			</p><p>(c) to examine his own concepts and values which may enable him to develop more useful attitudes about himself.
			</p><p>This type of skill remains consistently important for managers at all levels.
			</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/IMG/M1/11.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/><br/></center>
			
			<p>The above figure gives an idea about the required change in the skill-mix of a manager with the change in his level. At the top level, technical skill becomes least important. That is why, people at the top shift with great ease from one industry to another without an apparent fall in their efficiency. Their human and conceptual skills seem to make up for their unfamiliarity with the new job's technical aspects.</p>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')"><h1>12.	Analyse management as science and also as an art. (7-Marks) (1c) (Dec.2018 / Jan.2019| EC</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p><b>Management as a Science</b>
			</p><p>What makes a discipline a science? Should the discipline involve the use of a laboratory and a lab coat in order to be called a science? Obviously not. The hallmarks of a science are not the test tube or the lab coat. Instead, they are implicit in the method of inquiry used by a discipline for gathering the data We can call a discipline scientific if its 
			</p><p>1. methods of inquiry are systematic and empirical;
			</p><p>2. information can be ordered and analysed; and
			</p><p>3. results are cumulative and communicable.
			</p><p>Being systematic means being orderly and unbiased. The attempt to gain knowledge Must be with. out taint of personal or other prejudgement. Further, the inquiry must be empirical and not merely an armchair speculation or a priori approach.
			</p><p>All scientific information collected first as raw data is finally ordered and analysed with the help of statistical tools. It thus becomes communicable and intelligible. Communication of results also Permits repetition of the study, if need be, by the original investigator or others. When the study is replicated and the second try provides results similar to the original, one derives much more confidence in those results.
			</p><p>Science is also cumulative in that what is discovered is added to that which has been found before. Indeed, we ourselves, before we start, look around and find out first what has been done so that We need not start afresh from a low base each time. We learn from past mistakes and obtain guides for the future. We build upon the base that has been left by others.
			</p><p>On the basis of the above definition of science, we may presume that management is also science. But since the word "science" is used to denote two types of systematic knowledge-natural or exact and behavioural or inexact, some more explanation of the scientific nature of management is needed. We must remember that management is not like the exact or natural sciences (such as physics, chemistry), These sciences are called "exact" because here it is possible for us to study the effects of anyone of the many factors affecting a phenomenon individually by making the other factors inoperative for the time being. Thus, in physics it is possible for anyone to study in a laboratory, the effects of, say, only heat on the density of air by holding other factors (such as humidity) constant for the duration of the experiment. But the same thing is not possible in management where we have to study man and a multiplicity of factors affecting him.
			</p><p>For example, it is not possible to study the effect of, say, only monetary incentives on a worker's productivity because this effect will always be found to be mixed with and inseparable from other effects such as the leadership style of the worker's supervisor, worker's need hierarchy, the pressure of his co-workers, etc. At best, we can get only a rough idea of the relationship between the two. In other words, our findings are not going to be as accurate and dependable as those of the physical sciences. They are going to tell us about tendencies and probabilities only. We may, therefore, place management in the category of a behavioural science.
			</p><hr/><p><b>Management as an Art</b>
			</p><p>Whereas under "science" one normally learns the "why" of a phenomenon, under "art" one learns the "how" of it. Art is thus concerned with the understanding of how a particular work can be accomplished. Management in this sense is more an art.
			</p><p>It is the art of getting things done through others in dynamic and mostly non-repetitive situations. Whether it is a factory or a farm or a domestic kitchen, the resources of men, machine, and money have to be coordinated against several constraints to achieve given objectives in the most efficient manner.
			</p><p>The manager has to constantly analyse the existing situation, determine the objectives, seek alternatives, implement, coordinate, control and evaluate information and make decisions. A theoretical body of lessons and principles which a manager has learnt in a classroom will net secure for him the aimed results unless he has also the skill (or art) of applying such principles and body of knowledge to his special problem. Knowledge of management theory and principles is indeed a valuable aid and kit of the manager but it cannot replace his other managerial skills and qualities. This knowledge has to be applied and practised by the manager just as the medical or legal practitioners practise their respective sciences.
			</p><p>In this sense, management in an art. It is like the art of a musician or the art of a painter who seeks to achieve the desired effect with colour or instruments, but mainly with his own skill comprising his vision, knowledge of craft, and successful communication. He does not copy the skills of others.
			</p><p>We may thus conclude that management involves both elements those of a science and an art. While certain aspects of management make it a science, certain others which involve application of skill make it an art.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')"><h1>13.	Define planning. Explain any six limitations of planning. (7-Marks) (2a) (Dec.2018 / Jan.2019| EC</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>Limitations of Planning are as follows:
			</p><p>i.	Planning is an expensive and time-consuming process. It involves significant amounts of money, energy and also risk, without any assurance of the fulfilment of the organisation's objectives. In the view of this, many organisation, particularly the smaller ones, are usually unable to afford a formal planning programme.
			</p><p>ii.	Planning sometimes restricts the organisation to the most rational and risk-free opportunities. It curbs the initiative of the manager and forces him to operate within the limits set by it. Some-times planning may cause delay in decision-making. In an emergency when there is need for the manager to take a quick decision, he may be bogged down by rules and procedures.
			</p><p>iii.	The scope of planning is said to be limited in the case of organisations with rapidly changing situations. It is claimed that for industries producing fashionable articles or for industries engaged in the publication of textbooks, working on a day-to-day basis is more economical than on a planned basis.
			</p><p>iv.	Establishment of advance plans tends to make administration inflexible. When unforeseen changes in the environment, such as a business recession, change in government policy, crop failure, etc. take place, the original plan loses its value and there is need to draw up a fresh plan. But there is a tendency to make the original plan work.
			</p><p>v.	There is the difficulty of formulating accurate premises. Since these premises are the background against which a set of plans is made, they necessarily deal with the future. Since the future cannot be known with accuracy, premising must be subject to a margin of error.
			</p><p>vi.	Planning may sometimes face people's resistance to it. In old, established organisations, managers are often frustrated in instituting a new plan simply by the unwillingness or inability of people to accept it.
