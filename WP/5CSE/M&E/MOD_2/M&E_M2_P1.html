				<p>
					1.1 <strong>Autocratic leadership</strong><strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Autocratic leadership</strong>
					in this type of leadership, the leader alone determines policies and makes
					plans. He tells others what to do and how to do it. He demands strict
					obedience and relies on power. He may sometimes be benevolent also and use
					rewards for obtaining obedience from his employees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Employees is like both these forms because in one form they remain under
					constant fear and in the other form they remain under constant gratitude.
					In both the forms, the leader is the key person. The whole operation of the
					organisation depends upon him. In his absence it may function inadequately
					or not at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.1.1 </strong>
					<strong>Merit of Autocratic Leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. This type of leadership, can increase efficiency, save time and get
					quick results, especially in a Crisis Or an emergency situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. The paternalistic form of this style of leadership works well with
					employees who have a low tolerance for ambiguity, feel insecure with
					freedom and even minor decision-making requirements and thrive under clear,
					detailed and achievable directives.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong> iii. </strong>
					Chain of command, and division of work (who is supposed to do what) are
					clear and fully understood by all.<strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.1.2 </strong>
					<strong>De-Merit of Autocratic Leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. It motivates people through fear and stifles their initiative and
					creativity resulting in costly errors.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. It throttles upward communication, The autocratic leader is alone in
					his decision-making. He receives little, if any, information and ideas from
					his people as inputs into his decision-making. This is generally dangerous
					in today’s environment of technological and organisational complexity.
				</p>
				<p>
					iii. Today, most people resent authoritarian rule which excludes them from
					involvement and reduces them to machine-like cogs without human dignity or
					importance. They express their resentment in the form of massive
					resistance, low morale and low productivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2 </strong>
					<strong>Democratic leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					In this type of leadership (also known as participative or system-4
					management) the leader thinks “with” rather than “for” his people. The
					entire group is involved in and accepts responsibility for goal setting and
					achievement. Subordinates have considerable freedom of action. The leader
					shows greater concern for his people than for high production. A part of
					the leader’s task is to encourage and reinforce constructive inter-
					relationships among members and to reduce intra-group conflict and
					tensions. He Serves more as a Coordinator or agent for the group. Hence the
					group is not dependent upon him as an individual and can functions
					effectively in his absence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2.1 Merits </strong>
					<strong>Democratic leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. It increases the acceptability of a decision. When people participate in
					and help formulate a decision, they support it (instead of fighting or
					ignoring it) and work hard to make it work, because ‘tis their idea. In
					other words, the participative leader has the critical factor of
					built-in-personal motivation working for him.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. It improves the quality of a decision. The leader consistently receives
					the benefit of the best information, ideas, suggestions, and talent and
					operating experience of his people.
				</p>
				<p>
					iii. It permits and encourages people to develop, grow and rise in the
					organisation (both in terms of responsibility they can assume and service
					they can contribute).
				</p>
				<p>
					iv. It makes full use of a wide range of motivations such as status,
					achievement, challenge, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2.1 De-Merits </strong>
					<strong>Democratic leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. The participative style can take enormous amounts of time and, may
					degenerate into a complete loss of leader's control. Subordinates may show
					greater absenteeism and tardiness.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. Some leaders may use this style as a way of avoiding responsibility.
				</p>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>What is motivation? Explain Maslow's need hierarchy theory of motivation</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
				
				<p>
	<strong>2.1 Motivation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Technically, the term motivation can be traced to the Latin word movere,
	which means "to move". This meaning is evident when we remember that a
	manager gets work done through others. If there is any one key to "getting
	work done through others", it is his ability to move other people in the
	right direction day after day. To put it differently, regardless of how
	talented people are, they must be moved to action and continued in the
	course of action already initiated.
</p>
<p>
	Motivation, therefore, concerns those dynamic processes which produce a
	goal-directed behaviour. The process always begins with the individual
	feeling certain needs (also referred to as drives, instincts, wishes or
	motives). There is no unanimity among psychologists regarding the number
	and kinds of these drives.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2 Motivation Theories:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We classify the Motivation Theories into three broad heads:
</p>
<p>
	1. Content theories
</p>
<p>
	1.1 Maslow's Need Hierarch Theory
</p>
<p>
	1.2 Alderfer's ERG Theory
</p>
<p>
	1.3 Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory
</p>
<p>
	1.4 McClelland's Achievement Theory
</p>
<p>
	2. Process theories
</p>
<p>
	2.1 Victor Vroom's Expectancy Theory
</p>
<p>
	2.2 Adam's Equity Theory
</p>
<p>
	3. Reinforcement theory
</p>
<p>
	3.1 Skinner's Behaviour Modification Theory
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.3 Maslow's Need Hierarch Theory:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	All people have a variety of needs. At any given time, some of these needs
	are satisfied and others are unsatisfied. An unsatisfied need is the
	starting point in the motivation process. It begins the chain of events
	leading to behaviour.
</p>

alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/><br/>Fig 1.1: Order of Priority of Human Needs.</center>
<p>
	i. <strong>Basic Physiological Needs:</strong> Physiological needs are
	those which arise out of the basic physiology of life, for example, the
	need for water, air, etc. These needs must be at least partially satisfied
	for continued survival.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong>Safety/Security Needs:</strong> Security needs are the needs to
	feel both economically secure and psychologically secure. The former
	include protection from arbitrary lay-off and dismissal, disaster, and
	avoidance of the unexpected.
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong>Social Needs: </strong>Social needs are needs to associate
	with other people and be accepted by them to love and be loved. These needs
	are variously referred to as "the hard instinct", "gregariousness",
	"affiliation motive".
</p>
<p>
	iv. <strong>Esteem Needs:</strong> These include factors such as
	self-respect, autonomy status, recognition and attention.
</p>
<p>
	v. <strong>Self-Fulfilment Needs:</strong> It is the highest level of need
	in the hierarchy. It refers to the drive to become what one is capable of
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		2.4 Maslow's theory is based on the following assumptions:
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. People's behaviour is based on their needs. Satisfaction of such needs
	influences their behaviour.
</p>
<p>
	ii. People's needs are in hierarchical order, starting from basic needs to
	other higher-level needs.
</p>
<p>
	iii. A satisfied need can no longer motivate a person; only next
	higher-level need can motivate him.
</p>
<p>
	iv. A person moves to the next higher level of the hierarchy only when the
	lower need is satisfied.
