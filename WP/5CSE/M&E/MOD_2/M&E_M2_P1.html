				<p>
					1.1 <strong>Autocratic leadership</strong><strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Autocratic leadership</strong>
					in this type of leadership, the leader alone determines policies and makes
					plans. He tells others what to do and how to do it. He demands strict
					obedience and relies on power. He may sometimes be benevolent also and use
					rewards for obtaining obedience from his employees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Employees is like both these forms because in one form they remain under
					constant fear and in the other form they remain under constant gratitude.
					In both the forms, the leader is the key person. The whole operation of the
					organisation depends upon him. In his absence it may function inadequately
					or not at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.1.1 </strong>
					<strong>Merit of Autocratic Leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. This type of leadership, can increase efficiency, save time and get
					quick results, especially in a Crisis Or an emergency situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. The paternalistic form of this style of leadership works well with
					employees who have a low tolerance for ambiguity, feel insecure with
					freedom and even minor decision-making requirements and thrive under clear,
					detailed and achievable directives.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong> iii. </strong>
					Chain of command, and division of work (who is supposed to do what) are
					clear and fully understood by all.<strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.1.2 </strong>
					<strong>De-Merit of Autocratic Leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. It motivates people through fear and stifles their initiative and
					creativity resulting in costly errors.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. It throttles upward communication, The autocratic leader is alone in
					his decision-making. He receives little, if any, information and ideas from
					his people as inputs into his decision-making. This is generally dangerous
					in today’s environment of technological and organisational complexity.
				</p>
				<p>
					iii. Today, most people resent authoritarian rule which excludes them from
					involvement and reduces them to machine-like cogs without human dignity or
					importance. They express their resentment in the form of massive
					resistance, low morale and low productivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2 </strong>
					<strong>Democratic leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					In this type of leadership (also known as participative or system-4
					management) the leader thinks “with” rather than “for” his people. The
					entire group is involved in and accepts responsibility for goal setting and
					achievement. Subordinates have considerable freedom of action. The leader
					shows greater concern for his people than for high production. A part of
					the leader’s task is to encourage and reinforce constructive inter-
					relationships among members and to reduce intra-group conflict and
					tensions. He Serves more as a Coordinator or agent for the group. Hence the
					group is not dependent upon him as an individual and can functions
					effectively in his absence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2.1 Merits </strong>
					<strong>Democratic leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. It increases the acceptability of a decision. When people participate in
					and help formulate a decision, they support it (instead of fighting or
					ignoring it) and work hard to make it work, because ‘tis their idea. In
					other words, the participative leader has the critical factor of
					built-in-personal motivation working for him.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. It improves the quality of a decision. The leader consistently receives
					the benefit of the best information, ideas, suggestions, and talent and
					operating experience of his people.
				</p>
				<p>
					iii. It permits and encourages people to develop, grow and rise in the
					organisation (both in terms of responsibility they can assume and service
					they can contribute).
				</p>
				<p>
					iv. It makes full use of a wide range of motivations such as status,
					achievement, challenge, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2.1 De-Merits </strong>
					<strong>Democratic leadership:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					i. The participative style can take enormous amounts of time and, may
					degenerate into a complete loss of leader's control. Subordinates may show
					greater absenteeism and tardiness.
				</p>
				<p>
					ii. Some leaders may use this style as a way of avoiding responsibility.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>What is motivation? Explain Maslow's need hierarchy theory of motivation</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
				
				<p>
	<strong>2.1 Motivation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Technically, the term motivation can be traced to the Latin word movere,
	which means "to move". This meaning is evident when we remember that a
	manager gets work done through others. If there is any one key to "getting
	work done through others", it is his ability to move other people in the
	right direction day after day. To put it differently, regardless of how
	talented people are, they must be moved to action and continued in the
	course of action already initiated.
</p>
<p>
	Motivation, therefore, concerns those dynamic processes which produce a
	goal-directed behaviour. The process always begins with the individual
	feeling certain needs (also referred to as drives, instincts, wishes or
	motives). There is no unanimity among psychologists regarding the number
	and kinds of these drives.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2 Motivation Theories:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We classify the Motivation Theories into three broad heads:
</p>
<p>
	1. Content theories
</p>
<p>
	1.1 Maslow's Need Hierarch Theory
</p>
<p>
	1.2 Alderfer's ERG Theory
</p>
<p>
	1.3 Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory
</p>
<p>
	1.4 McClelland's Achievement Theory
</p>
<p>
	2. Process theories
</p>
<p>
	2.1 Victor Vroom's Expectancy Theory
</p>
<p>
	2.2 Adam's Equity Theory
</p>
<p>
	3. Reinforcement theory
</p>
<p>
	3.1 Skinner's Behaviour Modification Theory
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.3 Maslow's Need Hierarch Theory:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	All people have a variety of needs. At any given time, some of these needs
	are satisfied and others are unsatisfied. An unsatisfied need is the
	starting point in the motivation process. It begins the chain of events
	leading to behaviour.
</p>
<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/MOD_2/img/image0.png" 
alt="Order of Priority of Human Needs" class="resIMG"/><br/>Fig 1.1: Order of Priority of Human Needs.</center>
<p>
	i. <strong>Basic Physiological Needs:</strong> Physiological needs are
	those which arise out of the basic physiology of life, for example, the
	need for water, air, etc. These needs must be at least partially satisfied
	for continued survival.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong>Safety/Security Needs:</strong> Security needs are the needs to
	feel both economically secure and psychologically secure. The former
	include protection from arbitrary lay-off and dismissal, disaster, and
	avoidance of the unexpected.
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong>Social Needs: </strong>Social needs are needs to associate
	with other people and be accepted by them to love and be loved. These needs
	are variously referred to as "the hard instinct", "gregariousness",
	"affiliation motive".
</p>
<p>
	iv. <strong>Esteem Needs:</strong> These include factors such as
	self-respect, autonomy status, recognition and attention.
</p>
<p>
	v. <strong>Self-Fulfilment Needs:</strong> It is the highest level of need
	in the hierarchy. It refers to the drive to become what one is capable of
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		2.4 Maslow's theory is based on the following assumptions:
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. People's behaviour is based on their needs. Satisfaction of such needs
	influences their behaviour.
</p>
<p>
	ii. People's needs are in hierarchical order, starting from basic needs to
	other higher-level needs.
</p>
<p>
	iii. A satisfied need can no longer motivate a person; only next
	higher-level need can motivate him.
</p>
<p>
	iv. A person moves to the next higher level of the hierarchy only when the
	lower need is satisfied.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			<p>
	<strong>
		<br/>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.1 Definition:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	3.1.1 Newman &amp; Summer: "it is a exchange of facts, ideas, opinions or
	emotions by two or more persons"
</p>
<p>
	3.1.2 Allen Louis: "it as the sum of all the things one person does when he
	wants to create understanding in the minds of another"
</p>
<p>
	3.1.3 Simply stated, communication means the process of passing information
	and understanding from one person to another.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.2 Importance of communication</strong>
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/MOD_2/img/image2.png" 
alt="Importance of Communication" class="resIMG"/><br/>Fig 3.1: Importance of Communication.</center>
<p>
	i. Communication is needed in the <strong>recruitment process</strong> to
	persuade potential employees of the merits of working for the enterprise.
	The recruits are told about the company's organisation structure, its
	policies and practices.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Communication is needed in <strong>the area of orientation</strong> to
	make people acquainted with peers, superiors and with company's rules and
	regulations.
</p>
<p>
iii. Communication is needed	<strong>to enable employees to perform their functions effectively</strong>
	. Employees need to know their job's relationship and importance to the
	overall operation. This knowledge makes it easy for them to identify with
	the organisational mission. If a nurse in a hospital knows why she is to
	follow certain procedures with a patient and how this relates to the total
	therapy programme for him, it is much easier for her to develop an
	ideological commitment to the hospital.
</p>
<p>
	iv. Communication is needed to <strong>acquaint the subordinates</strong>
	with the evaluation of their contribution to enterprise activity. It is a
	matter of some motivational importance for the subordinates to know from
	their superior how they stand and what the future may hold for them. This
	appraisal, if intelligently carried out, boosts the subordinates' morale
	and helps them in building their career.
</p>
<p>
v. Communication is needed to	<strong>teach employees about personal safety on the job</strong>. This is
	essential to reduce accidents, to lower compensation and legal costs and to
	decrease recruitment and training cost for replacements.
</p>
<p>
	vi. Communication is of
	<strong>
		vital importance in projecting the image of an enterprise in the
		society
	</strong>
	. The amount of support which an enterprise receives from its social
	environment1s affected by the information which elite groups and the wider
	public have acquired about its goals, activities and accomplishments.
	During the 1982 blowout at Bombay High, ONGC took care to keep country
	informed about the steps that were being taken to combat the crisis.
	Contrast this W! Union Carbide which did nothing to refurbish its image
	after the Bhopal Gas leak.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 4. <h1>Describe the steps in controlling process. (6-Marks) (4b)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
    <strong>There are three basic steps in a control process:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I. Establishing standards
</p>
<p>
    Il. Measuring and comparing actual results against standards
</p>
<p>
    Ill. Taking corrective action
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. Establishing standards:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first step in the control process is to establish standards against
    which results can be measured. The standards the managers desire to obtain
    in each key area should be defined as far as possible in quantitative
    terms.
</p>
<p>
    The following points must be borne in mind when establishing standard
</p>
<p>
    i. The standards must be clear, accurate, precise, acceptable and workable.
</p>
<p>
    ii. Standards are used as the criteria or benchmarks by which performance
    is measured in the control process.
</p>
<p>
    iii. Standards should be flexible i.e., capable of being changed when the
    circumstances require so.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>II. Measuring and comparing results against standards:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    i. The second step in the control process is to measure the performance and
    compare it with the predetermined standards. Measurement of performance can
    be done by personal observation, by reports, charts and statements.
</p>
<p>
    ii. A quick comparison of actual performance with the standard fixed
    performance is possible, if the control system is well organized.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>III. Taking correct action: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    i. After comparing the actual performance with the prescribed standards and
    finding the deviations, the next step that should be taken by the manager
    is to correct these deviations. Corrective action should be taken without
    wasting of time so that the normal position can be restored quickly.
</p>
<p>
    ii. Taking corrective action can be achieved in the following way:
</p>
<p>
    a. The manager should try to influence environmental conditions and
    external situations in such a way as to facilitate the achievement of
    goals.
</p>
<p>
    b. He should review with his subordinates the instructions given earlier so
    that he may be able to give clear, complete and reasonable instructions in
    future.
</p>
<p>
    c. There are many external forces which cannot be adjusted by the manager.
    They must be accepted as the facts of the situation and the executives
    should revise their plans.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 5.<h1>What is the need for co-ordination? (5-Marks) (4c)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	<strong>5.1 Definition :</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Co-ordination is balancing and keeping together the team by ensuring
	suitable allocation of tasks to the various members and seeing that the
	tasks are performed with harmony among the members themselves.
	Co-ordination is defined by various authors as follows.
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong>E.F.L. Brech -</strong> Co-ordination is the process whereby an
	executive develops an orderly pattern of group efforts among his
	subordinates and secures unity of action in the pursuit of common purpose.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong>According to Terry</strong>, "Co-ordination deals with the task
	of blending efforts in order to ensure successful attainment of an
	objective. It is accomplished by means of planning, organizing directing
	and controlling".
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong>McFarland -</strong> Co-ordination is the orderly
	synchronizing of efforts of subordinates to provide proper amount, timing
	and quality of execution so that their united efforts lead to the stated
	objectives, namely, the common purpose of the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>5.2 Importance / Need of Co-Ordination:</strong>
</p>
<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/MOD_2/img/image3.png" 
alt="Importance of Co-Ordination" class="resIMG"/><br/>Fig 5.1: Importance of Co-Ordination.</center>
<p>
	i. Co-ordination integrates group efforts: Co-ordination unifies unrelated
	or diverse interests into purposeful work activity. It gives a common focus
	to group effort to ensure that performance is as it was planned and
	scheduled.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Il. Co-ordination ensures unity of action: The purpose of co-ordination
	is to secure unity of action in the realization of a common purpose.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Co-ordination is a continuous process: Co-ordination is not a one-time
	function but a continuous process. It begins at the planning stage and
	continue still controlling.
</p>
<p>
	iv. Co-ordination is the responsibility of all managers: Co-ordination is
	the function of every manager in the organization.
</p>
<p>
	v. Co-ordination is a deliberate function: A manager must co-ordinate the
	efforts of different people in a conscious and deliberate manner.
