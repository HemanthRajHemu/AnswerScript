			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 12.<h1>Summarize any six types of recruitment process. (6-Marks) (3c) (mod 1) </h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019| EC)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	<strong>12.1 INTERNAL SOURCES: </strong>
</p>
<p>
	The two important sources of internal recruitment are transfers and
	promotions,
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.1.1 Transfers: </strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. It involves shifting of an employee from one job to another, one
	department to another or from one shift to another, without a substantive
	change in the responsibilities and status of the employee.
</p>
<p>
	ii. It may lead to changes in duties and responsibilities, working
	condition etc.
</p>
<p>
	iii. It is a good source of filling the vacancies with employees from
	over-staffed departments.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.1.2 Promotions:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Business enterprises generally follow the practice of filling higher
	jobs by promoting employees from lower jobs.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Promotion leads to shifting of employees from lower to higher position,
	carrying higher responsibilities, facilities, status and pay. Promotion is
	a vertical shifting of employees.
</p>
<p>
	iii. This practice helps to improve the loyalty, motivation and
	satisfaction of employees.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.2 EXTERNAL SOURCES: </strong>
</p>
<p>
	All vacancies cannot be filled up from within the organization. Existing
	employees may lack the required skill, initiative and qualification needed
	for the jobs involved. Hence managers must recruit some persons from
	outside the organization.
</p>
<p>
	The various external sources of recruitment are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.2.1 </strong>
	<strong> Media Advertisements: </strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Advertisement in newspapers or trade and professional journals is
	generally used when a wider choice is required. Most of the senior
	positions of industry as well as commerce are filled by this method.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.2.2 </strong>
	<strong>Employment Exchanges:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Employment exchanges run by the Government are regarded as a good source
	of recruitment for unskilled and skilled operative jobs.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Employment exchanges help to match personnel demand and supply by
	serving as link between job-seekers and employers.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.2.3 </strong>
	<strong>Educational Institutions:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Companies maintain a close liaison with the universities, vocational
	institutes and management institute for recruitment of their staff. As and
	when the need arises, the companies send one or more of their senior
	executives to the education institutions.
</p>
<p>
	ii. These executives take the interview of the interested candidates and
	select the suitable candidates as per their requirement.
</p>
<p>
	iii. This process is popularly known as campus interview and is found to be
	an effective source of recruitment of managers, engineers, technicians,
	etc., for many companies on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.2.4 </strong>
	<strong>Recruitment at the Factory Gate:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. This is found mainly in case of factory workers to be recruited on daily
	wages.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Such workers gather in the morning at the factory gate to serve as
	casual workers.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Very often existing regular employees go on leave and their vacancies
	are filled up by recruitment at the factory gate.
</p>
<p>
	iv. These casual workers having served in the factory for some time may be
	considered for regular employment at some stages.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>12.2.5 </strong>
	<strong>Referrals:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Quite often the management gets references about interested workers from
	different sources like worker's unions, previous employees, existing
	employees, clients of the organization, etc.
</p>
<p>
	ii. These sources are important because their recommendations are made by
	people who are associated with the organization.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 13.<h1>Explain any five techniques of co-ordination. (6-Marks) (4a)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019| EC)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	13.1 <strong>Techniques of Co-ordination are as follows:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Effective chain of command: It decides who is responsible to whom. If
	the line of authority and responsibilities are clearly defined, manager can
	access control over subordinate.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Harmonious rules, policies and procedures: They are used as guidelines
	for decision making in consistent manner.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Clearly defined objectives: Objectives are to be clearly defined so
	that employees of organization will understand them well.
</p>
<p>
	iv. Co-ordination through liaison officer: Liaison officer links two
	departments for effective co-ordination between interdependent departments
	like production and sales, organization and govt. etc.
</p>
<p>
	v. Sound organizational structure: It integrates activities of different
	units of organization resulting in better co-ordination.
</p>
<p>
	vi. Incentives: They are increments in pay, bonus, profit sharing etc.
	These schemes of incentives promote better spirit and cooperation between
	employers and workers, between workers and supervisors and ensures better
	co-ordination.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 15.<h1>List four important characteristics of leadership. (4-Marks) (4c)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019| EC)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	<strong>15.0 Characteristics of Leadership are as follows:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>15.1 Leadership implies the existence of followers:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We appraise the quality of a person's leadership in practice by studying
	his followers. We ask: How many and what kind of followers does he have?
	How strong is their commitment as a result of his leadership? How long will
	their commitment last? By answering questions of this nature we get to know
	the quality of leadership. We must not, however, forget that leaders within
	organisations are also followers. The supervisor works for a branch head,
	who works for a division manager, who works for the vice-president of a
	department, and so on. Thus, in formal organisations of several levels, a
	leader has to be able to wear both hats gracefully, to be able to relate
	himself both upwards &amp; downwards.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>15.2 Leadership involves </strong>
	<strong>
		a community of interest between the leader and his followers:
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	In other words, the objectives of both the leader and his men are one and
	the same. If the leader strives for one purpose and his team of workers for
	some other Purpose, it is no leadership. In the words of G.R. Terry,
	"Leadership is the activity of influencing people to strive willingly for
	mutual objectives".
</p>
<p>
	<strong>15.3 Leadership involves an </strong>
	<strong>
		unequal distribution of authority among leaders and group members:
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Leaders can direct some of the activities of group members; that is the
	group members are compelled or are willing to obey most of the leader's
	directions. The group members cannot similarly direct the leader's
	activities, though they will obviously affect those activities in a number
	of ways.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		15.4 Leadership implies that leaders can influence their followers or
		subordinates in addition to being able to give their followers or
		subordinates legitimate directions:
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	In other words, leaders not only tell their subordinates what to do by way
	of command but also influence by their behaviour and conduct. The use of
	command by leaders succeeds only in bringing about a temporary behavioural
	change in the followers.
</p>
