			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	<strong>7.1 Definition &amp; Meaning:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Business organizations have always given due importance to its managers who
	are capable of leading others. A manager needs to use various ways to lead,
	motivate and inspire the subordinates and to communicate with them
	suitably.
</p>
<p>
	According to Koonz and O'Donnel, "Direction is a complex function that
	includes all those activities which are designed to encourage subordinates
	to work effectively and efficiently in both the short and long term".
</p>
<p>
	i. Direction is an important managerial function which stimulates the
	organization and its staff to execute the plans. Manager should give
	direction to his subordinates through orders and supervise the work to
	ensure plans and policies. It breaks down into 2 activities.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Giving orders to employees.
</p>
<p>
	iii. Leading and motivating them.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2 Principles of Direction</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2.1 Creation of synergy of individual efforts</strong>
	. We know that Organizations comprise of numerous individuals with diverse
	set of personal objectives, beliefs and values. An effective direction
	would align their personal objectives towards the organizational objectives
	so that individuals start behaving like a coherent team, thus resulting in
	synergy of individual efforts.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2.2 Unity of command</strong>
	: People tend to get confused when they get direction and orders from more
	than one superior. Some of these orders may be completely divergent to each
	other, thus adding to the misery of the subordinates who are supposed to
	follow them. Therefore, unity of command and direction is a useful
	principle.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2.3 Close interaction with subordinates:</strong>
	It is important for the bosses to have close interaction with their
	subordinates to guide them, mentor them and empathize with them. The human
	contact creates a unique sense of direction, which at times is difficult to
	achieve by other modes of communication in this networked world.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2.4 Feedback and suggestions for improvement:</strong>
	Occasional feedbacks on performance, particularly the positive feedbacks
	from superiors to subordinates are encouraging for them. Negative feedbacks
	should be inter-ensconced with constructive suggestions for improvement so
	as to minimize the hurt-feeling on part of the subordinates.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2.5 Motivate, enthuse and enthrall:</strong>
	Motivation lies at the heart of direction. People should be directed in
	such a way that they feel motivated, enthused and fascinated to follow the
	directions given to them whole-heartedly.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7.2.6 Lead by example:</strong>
	It is the principle which says "preach what you practice". Thus, followers
	understand the directions of their leader much better, when the leader
	follows herself what she preaches. For example, a boss who is very strict
	about the timely arrival of employees to office, need to be punctual
	himself.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	<strong>8.1 </strong>
	<strong>DEFINITIONS AND MEANING OF LEADERSHIP</strong>
</p>
<p>
	There are many definitions of leadership. Some of the definitions of
	leadership are reproduced below:
</p>
<p>
	i. "Leadership" according to Alford and Beatty" is the ability to secure
	desirable actions from a group of followers voluntarily, without the use of
	coercion".
</p>
<p>
	ii. According to Chester I. Barnard, "It (leadership) refers to the quality
	of the behaviour of the individual whereby they guide people on their
	activities in organized efforts".
</p>
<p>
	iii. According to Terry, "A leader shows the way by his own example. He is
	not a pusher; he pulls rather than pushes".
</p>
<p>
	iv. According to Koontz and O' Donnell - Managerial leadership is "The
	ability to exert interpersonal influence by means of communication, towards
	the achievement of a goal". Since managers get things done through people,
	their success depends, to a considerable extent upon their ability to
	provide leadership.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>8.2 </strong>
	<strong>LEADERSHIP STYLES</strong>
</p>
<p>
	There are three important approaches of leadership, they are
</p>
<p>
	(a) Traits approach
</p>
<p>
	(b) Behavioral approach and
</p>
<p>
	(c) Contingency approach
</p>
<p>
	<strong>8.2.1 Traits approach: </strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Leader should have good health and physical fitness, intelligence,
	mental and physical energy, knowledge of human relation, personal
	motivation, communication skills, qualities of a leader.

</p>
<p>
	b. Moral qualities
</p>
<p>
	c. Mental qualities
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Physical qualities:</strong>
	Leader must have physical energy to stand up to stress and strain of his
	office and responsibility.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Moral qualities:</strong>
	This quality helps to stick on his goal and to own the responsibility of
	his action.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Mental qualities:</strong>
	A leader must possess this quality to be able to motivate his subordinates
	into action.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	<strong>8.2.2 Behavior approach:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong>Motivation:</strong> Positive motivation makes his subordinates
	to rewards, negative motivation makes his subordinates punishment.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong>Authority:</strong> Leadership styles can be automatic,
	democratic or free region.
</p>
<p>
	a. <strong>Autocratic:</strong> Autocratic leader take decision without
	consulting subordinates. They simply pass the orders and it should be
	obeyed by subordinates. This enforces discipline and obedience. Decision
	making is completely centralized. Communication is one way always in the
	form of instructions and orders. Subordinates should depend on leader for
	everything. Leader just supervise his subordinates.
</p>
<p>
	b. <strong>Democratic on consultive leadership:</strong> Leaders consult
	their subordinates before taking decision. It provides complete freedom to
	group members and result in two-way communication emphasis is given

	Free rein leaders leaves the subordinates with complete freedom.
	Subordinates can set their plans and develop plans. Decision are made by
	subordinates. Leaders do not involve in it. Leaders will advise. Leader
	will not control followers. Here subordinates must be knowledgeable, well
trained and self-motivated it develops managerial skills and creativity.	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>8.2.3 </strong>
	<strong>Contingency approach:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	i. Fielders model
</p>
<p>
	ii. Hersy and Blanchard's model
</p>
<p>
	iii. Robert j Houser's model
</p>
<p>
	I. <strong>Fielders model:</strong> Leadership style depends on situation
	favour. It depends on three factors.
</p>
<p>
	a. Leader member relation - leader member relationship is good only if
	leader is respected.
</p>
<p>
	b. Task structure - Task oriented leader is most effective in extreme
	situation where situation is favourable or unfavourable,
</p>
<p>
	c. Position power- Position power leadership means leader is highly
	positioned and highly powered. The role of the leadership is effective.
</p>
<p>
	<strong> II. </strong>
	<strong>Hersey and Blanchard model: - </strong>
</p>
<p>
	a. This model contains four stages, initial phase, when subordinates first
	enter into organization they need to be instructed and rules and
	regulations are expressed. Manager should be low in relationship because
	subordinates cannot be treated as colleagues.
</p>
<p>
	b. As subordinates matures, manager trust increases grow high relationship
	between manager and subordinates. Subordinate is needed to be in high task.
</p>
<p>
	c. In third phase subordinates is so matured no need of manager but still
	required for support finally subordinates become highly matured, motivated
	and directing the manager.
</p>
