			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')"><h1>34.	Name and explain various categories of standing plans and single-use plans. (6-Marks) (2b)  (Dec.2017/ Jan.2018|EE</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			<p><b>Standing Plans:</b>
			</p><p>These plans are designed for situations that recur often enough to justify a standardised approach. For example, it would be inefficient for a bank to develop a new plan for processing a loan application of each new client, Instead, it uses one standing plan that anticipates in advance whether to approve or turn down any request based on the information furnished, credit rating and the like. The major types of standing plans are policies, procedures, methods and rules.
			</p><p><b>Policies</b> A policies a general guideline for decision-making. It sets up boundaries around decisions including those that can be made and shutting out those that cannot. In so doing, it channelizes the thinking of the organisation members so that it is consistent with and contribute to the organisational objectives. 
			</p><p>In the words of George R. Terry, “policy is a verbal, written or implied overall guide, setting up boundaries that supply the general limits and direction in which managerial action will take place”
			</p><p><b>Procedures:</b> Policies are carried out by means of more detailed guidelines called “procedures”. A procedure provides a detailed set of instructions for performing a sequence of actions involved in doing a certain piece of work. The same steps are followed each time that activity is performed.
			</p><p>Methods A method is a prescribed way in which one step of a procedure is to be performed. The specified technique to be used in screening the application or conducting a written test is a method, whereas the sequence of steps involved in the recruitment of personnel constitutes a procedure.
			</p><p><b>Rules:</b> Rules are detailed and recorded instructions that a specific action must or must not be per. Formed in a given situation. In requiring, to buy from a certain company regardless of price or serving in sanctioning overtime to workmen, in regulating travelling allowances, in sanctioning entertainment bills and in other similar matters, a uniform way of handling them or dealing with the case has to be followed. These are all covered by the rules of the enterprise, the objective of which is to avoid repeated reference to higher levels for authorisation of routine matters which occur frequently. Like procedures rules also bring in predictability. They make sure that a job is done in the same manner every time. bringing uniformity in efforts and results. In addition, they allow simple screening of violations and  legitimize punishment when violated. But their literal interpretation may sometimes lead to ritualism centre officiousness.
			</p><hr/><p><b>Single-use Plans</b>
			</p><p>These plans, as their name suggests, are developed to achieve a specific end; when that end is achieved, the plan is dissolved. The major types of these plans are programmes and budgets.
			</p><p><b>Programmes:</b> Programmes are precise plans which need to be made to discharge a non-routine and non-repetitive task. Thus, an enterprise may have a programme of opening five branches in different parts of the country or of deputing its employees for training or of acquiring a new line of business or installing new machines in the factory or of introducing a new product in the market. The essential ingredients of every programme are time phasing and budgeting.
			</p><p><b>Budget:</b> According to the Institute of costs and works accountants, London, a budget is a “a financial and/or quantitative statement prepared prior to a definite period of time, of the policy to be pursued during that period, for the purpose of obtaining a given objective”. The important budget are sales budget, production budget, cash budget, and revenue and expense budget.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')"><h1>35.	Write a chart depicting a typical decision making process to an organization and explain the need for decision making. (4-Marks) (2c) (Dec.2017/ Jan.2018|EE</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p><b>Need for decision making are as follows:</b>
			</p><p><b>34.1 Non-actionable Information</b>
			</p><p>This is a major problem for every manager. Actionable information is the information that can become the basis for action. Such information has to be timely, complete and accurate. Finally, it has to incorporate data pertaining to the future in most instances.
			</p><p><b>34.2 Un-supporting Environment</b>
			</p><p>The environment—physical and organisational—that prevails in an enterprise affects both the nature of decisions and their implementation. If there is all round goodwill and trust and if the employees are properly motivated, the manager is encouraged to take decisions with confidence. On the other hand, under the opposite circumstances he avoids decision-making.
			</p><p><b>34.3 Non-Acceptance by Subordinates</b>
			</p><p>If subordinates have a stake in the decision or are likely to be strongly affected by it, acceptance will probably be necessary for effective implementation. On the other hand, subordinates may not really care what decision is reached. In such situations, acceptance is not an issue. Democratic leadership style which encourages subordinates to suggest, criticise, make recommendations or decide upon policies or projects is an effective device for gaining their acceptance and commitment.
			</p><p><b>34.4 Ineffective Communication</b>
			</p><p>Another important problem in decision-making is the ineffective communication of a decision. This makes implementation difficult. The manager should, therefore, take care to communicate all decisions to the employees in clear, precise and simple language.
			</p><p><b>34.5 Incorrect Timing</b>
			</p><p>In decision-making, the problem is not merely of taking a correct decision. It is also of selecting an appropriate time for taking the decision. If the decision is correct but the time is inopportune, it will not serve any purpose. For example, if the manager wants to decide about introducing a new product the market, he should take the decision at a correct time. Otherwise, he may lose the market to his competitors,
