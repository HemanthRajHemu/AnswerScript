	A <strong><h2>Project Report</h2></strong> is a document which provides details on
the overall picture of the proposed business. The<strong><h2>project report</h2></strong> gives an account of the	<strong><h2>project</h2></strong> proposal to ascertain the prospects of the
	proposed plan/activity. <strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1 PLANNING COMMISSION GUIDELINES:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	To process investment proposals and arrive at investment decisions, the
	Planning Commission of India has also issued some guidelines for
	preparing/formulating realistic industrial projects. So far as feasibility
	report is concerned, it lies in between the project formulating stage and
	the appraisal and sanction stage. The project formulation stage involves
	the identification of investment options by the enterprise and in
	consultation with the Administrative Ministry, the Planning Commission and
	other concemed authorities.
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong><h2>General information:</h2></strong> The feasibility report should
	include an analysis of the industry to which the project belongs. It should
	deal with the past performance of the industry. The description ofthe type
	of industry should also be given, i.e., the priority of the industry,
	increase in production, role of the public sector, allocation of investment
	of funds, choice of technique, etc. This should also contain information
	about the enterprise submitting the feasibility report.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong><h2>Preliminary analysis of alternatives:</h2></strong> This should
	contain Present data on the gap between demand and supply for the outputs
	which are to be produced, data on the capacity that would be available,
	complete list of all existing plants in the industry, giving their capacity
	and level of production, list of all projects for which letters of licenses
	have been issued and list of proposed projects. the location of the project
	as well as its implications, an account of the foreign exchange
	requirement, the profitability of different options should be given, rate
	of return on investment should be calculated and presented in the report.
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong><h2>Project description:</h2></strong> The feasibility report should
	provide a brief description of the technology/process chosen for the
	project. The report should contain a list of important items of capital
	equipment and the list of the operational requirements of the plant,
	requirements of water and power, requirements of personnel, organizational
	structure envisaged, transport costs, activity wise phasing of construction
	and factors affecting it.
</p>
<p>
	iv. <strong><h2>Marketing plan:</h2></strong> It should contain the following items:
	Data on the marketing plan, demand and prospective supply in each of the
	areas to be served.
</p>
<p>
	v. <strong><h2>Capital Requirements and Costs:</h2></strong> The estimates should be
	reasonably complete and properly estimated. Information on all items of
	costs should be carefully collected and presented.
</p>
<p>
	vi. <strong><h2>Operating Requirements and Costs:</h2></strong> Operating costs are
	essentially those costs which are incurred after the commencement of
	commercial production. Information about all items of operating cost should
	be collected; operating costs relate to the cost of raw materials and
	intermediates, fuel, utilities, labour, repair and maintenance, selling
	expenses and other expenses.
</p>
<p>
	vii. <strong><h2>Financial Analysis:</h2></strong> The purpose of this analysis is
	to present some measures to assess the financial viability of the project.
	A preform a Balance Sheet for the project data should be presented.
	Depreciation should be allowed for based on specified by the Bureau of
	Public Enterprises. Foreign exchange requirements should be cleared by the
	Department of Economic Affairs. The feasibility report should consider
	income-tax rebates for priority industries, incentives for backward areas,
	accelerated depreciation, etc. The sensitivity analysis should also be
	presented. The report must analyse the sensitivity of the rate of return of
	change in the level and pattern of product prices.
</p>
<p>
	viii. <strong><h2>Economic Analysis:</h2></strong> Social profitability analysis
	needs some adjustment in the data relating to the costs and returns to the
	enterprise. One important type of investment involves a correction in input
	and costs, to reflect the true value of foreign exchange, labour and
	capital. The enterprise should try to assess the impact of its operations
	on foreign trade. Indirect costs and benefits should also be included in
	the report. If they cannot be quantified, they should be analysed and their
	importance emphasized.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 4<h1>Explain the objectives of market research. (10-Marks) (8b)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	The Objectives of Market Research are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2> i. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>To Know the Buyers:</h2></strong>
	<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Marketing is to do with people, product and process of transfer. Each firm
	is eager to know about all those persons who are willing to pay for the
	firm's products or services. This knowledge pertains to buyer variables
	such as number of buyer's frequency of buying regional location social
	category and so on. Useful information may emerge if above based basic data
	are made available.
</p>
<p>
	Thus, the data may indicate that in some areas sales are highly
	concentrated while in some sporadic and widespread. If such useful
	information is made available for several years, growth rate can be found
	out; variance can be traced and enquired into so that market potential is
	made known.
</p>
<h4>
	ii. To Measure the Impact of Promotional Efforts:
</h4>
<p>
	In modern days of changing marketing conditions, it is quite likely that a
	company may follow different strategies to promote a product of a service.
	Promotion-mix or the communication-mix today is consisting of three major
	elements, namely, advertising, personal selling and sales-promotion.
</p>
<p>
	Each element has sub elements. It is quite possible that some promotional
	strategies are strikingly appealing and some are total flop.
</p>
<p>
	Though some are successful, the overall analysis gives unexpected poor
	results. Research in these areas of promotion mix effectiveness will enable
	the researcher to gauge the strength and weakness of the mix components so
	that it can be suitably changed to better the results.
</p>
<p>
	It reduces to a very great extent in detecting the point of satisfaction
	and contribution of a medium or a vehicle in a medium. In effect, it helps
	in cutting the dead-weight to restore the sound health.
</p>
<h4>
	iii. To Know Consumer Response:
</h4>
<p>
	Any consumer oriented company cannot remain contended if it 'somehow' makes
	it possible to reach the target sales. It is more keen on knowing consumer
	response for its efforts of delivering the products.
</p>
<p>
	Study of consumer response can also be known market-product testing. An
	alert company monitors the consumer reactions to the product so released in
	the market.
</p>
<p>
	In other words, the company is eager to know consumer opinion about the
	degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction that the product has generated or
	caused. Such clues pave the way for product improvement in terms of
	quality, design, size, colour, appearance, packing, packaging materials,
	distribution methods and so on. Thus, market product testing helps in sound
	product planning and improved product development to meet the much desired
	consumer needs.
</p>
<h4>
	iv. To Know Market Costs and Profits:
</h4>
<p>
	There has been a hue and cry all over the world that marketing costs have
	escalated to such an extent that optimisation of profit has become a big
	problem. Marketing cost is an input employed by a company to execute its
	marketing programme and is used as a standard measure of performance.
</p>
<p>
	Research relating to total marketing costs and their break-up helps in
	appraising and indicating these marketing policies and procedures whose
	cost is not commensurate with the results.
</p>
<p>
	It makes marketing management cost conscious Research has the objective of
	cost control and reduction so that the consumers are given reduction in
	prices and a rise in profit to the marketers.
</p>
<p>
	Cost analysis leads to profit analysis that gives profit performance by
	regions, products, and customers. These findings of cost behaviour impel
	certain changes of adjustments in promotion, pricing and distribution.
</p>
<h4>
	v. To Master the External Forces:
</h4>
<p>
	The firm's policies and strategies undergo change as warranted by the
	internal controllable factors and external uncontrollable forces. Each
	company needs reliable information about competitor's moves, the company's
	share in the market, and developments in foreign markets, governmental
	policies, technological changes, ecological variations, consumer incomes,
	consumer spending, new products substitutes and the like.
</p>
<p>
	These are the forces that keep on changing themselves and making the firms
	to change accordingly. Research in these areas is a must to survive and
	survive successfully. Research makes firm adaptive as it gets innovative.
</p>
<h4>
	vi. To Design and Implement Marketing Control:
</h4>
<p>
	Marketing control is the final or terminal job in the marketing management.
	It is the task of monitoring and feeding back the marketing performance and
	its measurement and evaluation against the planned performance standards so
	as to identify deviations, correct them as they occur and provide input for
	plan revision.
</p>
<p>
	Marketing planning or sales forecasting leads to development of marketing
	control process. Plans have no meaning unless they are materialized.
	Control decides whether the actual efforts are in tune with planned course.
