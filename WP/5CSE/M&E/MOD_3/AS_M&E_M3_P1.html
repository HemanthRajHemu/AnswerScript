			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
				
				<p>
	Classification of Entrepreneur are as follow:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.1: </strong>
	<strong>Based on Functional Characteristics</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.1.1. Innovative entrepreneur:</strong>
	Such entrepreneurs introduce new goods or new methods of production or
	discover new markets or reorganise their enterprises. Entrepreneurs in this
	group are characterised by an aggressive assemblage of information for
	trying out a novel combination of factors. Such entrepreneurs can do well
	only when a certain level of development has already been achieved; they
	look forward to improving upon the past.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.1.2. Imitative or adoptive entrepreneur:</strong>
	Such entrepreneurs do not innovate themselves, but imitate techniques and
	technology innovated by others. Entrepreneurs in this group are
	characterised by their readiness to adopt successful innovations by
	successful entrepreneurs. Such entrepreneurs are particularly suitable for
	underdeveloped economies as adoption saves costs of trial and error.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.1.3. Fabian entrepreneur:</strong>
	Such entrepreneurs display great caution and scepticism in experimenting
	with any change in their enterprise. They change only when there is an
	imminent threat to the very existence of their enterprise.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.1.4. Drone entrepreneur:</strong>
	Such entrepreneurs are characterised by a die-hard conservatism and may
	even be prepared to suffer the loss of business.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.2 Based on the Developmental Angle</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.2.1. Prime mover:</strong>
	This entrepreneur sets in motion a powerful sequence of development,
	expansion, and diversification of business.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.2.2. Manager:</strong>
	Such an entrepreneur does not initiate expansion and is content just
	staying in business.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.2.3. Minor innovator:</strong>
	This entrepreneur contributes to economic progress by finding better use
	for existing resources.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.2.4. Satellite:</strong>
	This entrepreneur assumes a supplier's role and slowly moves towards a
	productive enterprise.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.2.5. Local trading:</strong>
	Such an entrepreneur limits his enterprise to the local market.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.3 Based on Types of Entrepreneurial Business </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.3.1. Manufacturing:</strong>
	An entrepreneur who runs such a business actually produces the products
	that can be sold using resources and supplies. For example, apparel and
	other textile products, chemical and related products, electronics and
	other electrical equipment, fabricated metal products, industrial machinery
	and equipment, printing and publishing, rubber and miscellaneous plastic
	products, stone, clay etc.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.3.2. Wholesaling:</strong>
	An entrepreneur with such a business sells products to the middle man.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.3.3. Retailing:</strong>
	An entrepreneur with such a business sells products directly to the people
	who use or consume them.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.3.4. Service:</strong>
	An entrepreneur in this business sells services rather than products.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4 Based on the Nine Personality Types of Entrepreneurs</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.1. The Improver:</strong>
	If you operate your business predominately in the improver mode, you are
	focused on using your company as a means to improve the world. Your
	overarching motto is: morally correct companies will be re-warded working
	on a noble cause. Improvers have an unwavering ability to run their
	business with high integrity and ethics.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.2 The Advisor:</strong>
	This business personality type will provide an extremely high level of
	assistance and advice to customers. The advisor's motto is: the customer is
	right and we must do everything to please them. Companies built by advisors
	become customer focused.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.3. The Superstar:</strong>
	Here the business is centred on the charisma and high energy of the
	Superstar CEO. This personality often will cause you to build your business
	around your own personal brand.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.4 The Artist:</strong>
	This business personality is the reserved but a highly creative type. Often
	found in businesses demanding creativity such as web design and ad
	agencies. As an artist type you'll tend to build your business around the
	unique talents and creativities that you have.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.5 The Visionary:</strong>
	A business built by a Visionary will often be based on the future vision
	and thoughts of the founder. You will have a high degree of curiosity to
	understand the world around you and will set-up plan to avoid the
	landmines.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.6. The Analyst:</strong>
	If you run a business as an Analyst, your company focus is on fixing
	problems in a systematic way. Often the basis for science, engineering or
	computer firms, Analyst companies excel at problem solving.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.7. The Fireball:</strong>
	A business owned and operated by a Fireball is full of life, energy and
	optimism. Your company is life energizing and makes customers feel the
	company has a get it done attitude in a fun playful manner.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.8. The Hero:</strong>
	You have an incredible will and ability to lead the world and your business
	through any challenge. You are the essence of entrepreneurship and can
	assemble great companies.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1.4.9. The Healer:</strong>
	If you are a Healer, you provide nurturing and harmony to your business.
	You have an uncanny ability to survive and persist with an inner calm.

	<strong>2.2 Stages in Entrepreneurial Process:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Barringer and Gresock (2008) identified various stages in the
	entrepreneurial process as shown in below Figure.
</p>
<p align="center">
	<img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/MOD_3/IMG/2.1.png" 
alt="Stages in Entrepreneurial Process" class="resIMG"/><br/>
	Fig 2.1: Stages in Entrepreneurial Process
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.1 Genesis of a business idea:</strong>
	This is the first step in the entrepreneurial process and requires critical
	thinking on part of the entrepreneur to select the most viable business
	ideas from a set of available options. This not only includes critical
	analysis of the merits and demerits of the innovative product/service
	created by the entrepreneur, but also includes the study of the market
	potential (the existing and potential competitors), marketing, finance,
	human resources, and operational issues related to the business idea.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.2 Conduct preliminary feasibility</strong>
	: The preliminary feasibility involves a quick assessment about the
	potential of the business ideas and screening out an idea with the highest
	potential. This step is necessary to ensure that comprehensive and detailed
	feasibility analysis (which involves considerable time and effort) to be
	conducted in the next step is done only for the single best idea.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.3 Detailed feasibility analysis:</strong>
	Having screened out an idea with high potential, it is subjected to the
	detailed feasibility analysis which may take a couple of days or weeks. The
	detailed analysis is helpful in making suitable modifications in the
	business idea before taking it to the business plan stage.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.3.1 Product/service feasibility:</strong>
	The feasibility of the product/service is performed by concept testing,
	i.e. showing - concept or idea to a sample group of potential customers to
	gauge their reaction, to take their suggestions for further development of
	the concept and to assess its sales potential. A prototype or a sample unit
	of the product can also be created in simple form depending upon the cost
	involved.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.3.2 Industry/Market feasibility:</strong>
	The feasibility analysis of industry/market involves three considerations.
	Firstly, how attractive is the market for the new business idea or concept.
	A market segment experiencing growth, with high prof margins and less
	competition would naturally be attractive for the entrepreneur, Secondly,
	efforts should be expended to identify the niche within a large marker,
	i.e. an arrow segment of customers with a common expectation from the
	product or service. This way, the entrepreneur can buy sometime for
	establishing his venture before competing head-on with existing established
	players in the market. Last but not the least, a candid assessment of the
	overall market potential of the new concept should be made in realistic
	manner.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.3.3 Organizational feasibility:</strong>
	Two issues should be addressed here: an assessment about the organizational
	prowess or capability of the initial management team (which would naturally
	be small for the start-up firm, including the entrepreneur), and the
	availability of non-financial resources (like office space, talent pool in
	the area where the venture would be started, etc.).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.3.4 Financial feasibility:</strong>
	The total initial cash needed for starting the venture and overall
	financial attractiveness of the investment are at the heart of financial
	feasibility. It should be kept in mind that very rarely do new start-up
	ventures are able to secure funding from the financial institutions as debt
	or are able to find equity investors (people who are willing to invest
	money by becoming partners in the venture). Therefore, very clear
	identification about the sources of sufficient funds to cover all the
	capital expenditures and operating (recurring) expenses to generate first
	unit of the ales should be done.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.4 Write a business plan:</strong>
	A business plan is a written document containing the details about every
	aspect of the proposed business venture.It serves two purposes: to provide
	a "road map" for the people internal to the organization, i.e. the
	employees, stakeholders, etc., and to convince the potential investors and
	financial institutions about the viability of the venture so that they may
	agree to invest in it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.2.5 Launch the venture:</strong>
	This is the final step in the entrepreneurial process and involves
	launching the venture as per the business plan. Due to the uncertainties of
	the business environment, the entrepreneur should be prepared to face
	hurdles and challenges during the launching of the venture as well as in
	the subsequent periods of time.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3.<h1>What are the barriers of Entrepreneurs? (6-Marks) (6a)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			<p>
	<strong>Barriers in Entrepreneurship are as follows:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Krasniqi (2007) identified various barriers to entrepreneurship as shown in
	below figure.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.1 Macroeconomic environment:</strong>
	Macroeconomic environment conducive to entrepreneurship is dependent upon
	the policies of the government in supporting private participation in
	business. Macro means large and the term macroeconomic means the larger
	view of the economy. It is different from the micro (small) view which
	concerns a firm or a company in the market. For example, in India the
	process of liberalization started during the mid-1980s whereby the
	government started the process of encouraging foreign MNCs (multinational
	corporations) to create joint ventures (JVs) with Indian domestic
	companies. This process created a macroeconomic environment in which many
	new small and medium enterprises (SMEs) evolved to become suppliers and
	vendors for the JVs so created.
</p>

<img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/M&E/MOD_3/IMG/3.1.png" 
alt="Stages in Entrepreneurial Process" class="resIMG"/><br/>
	Fig 3.1: Barriers to Entrepreneurship
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.2 Legal and regulatory environment:</strong>
	The legal and regulatory environment for entrepreneurship is formed by
	registration and licensing procedures, commercial and contractual laws,
	property rights laws, bankruptcy and collateral law, real estate
	regulations and labour laws. If the administrative procedures and laws are
	unclear, time-consuming and cumbersome, they would pose barriers to
	entrepreneurship.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.3 Corruption and unfair competition:</strong>
	A corrupt economy can lead to unfair competition, which in turn can become
	a major deterrent to entrepreneurial activity. Excessive regulations and
	approvals from the government required by entrepreneurs may make the
	government officials corrupt.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.4 Financial obstacles:</strong>
	Start-up ventures are usually dependent upon capital to be sourced from
	banks and financial institutions. It has 48 been observed that in many
	economies banks are reluctant to give loans to small start-up firms.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.5 Tax burden:</strong>
	In many regions, the government charges high taxes from even small start-up
	ventures and has tedious procedures for compliance of tax submission
	formalities. In order to promote entrepreneurship, the governments would
	need to have rational tax structures with easy tax submission procedures.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.6 Challenges in attracting talent:</strong>
	This is another big issue faced by small start-up companies. The best of
	talent in engineering, management and other disciplines wants to work for
	multinational corporations (MNCs)rather than for small start-ups. This
	attitude of professionals makes it difficult for entrepreneurs to attract
	them for their entrepreneurial ventures. Thus, there is a dire need to
	create an ecosystem for entrepreneurship so that budding professionals
	start valuing their association with entrepreneurial ventures compared to
	working for the MNCs.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>3.7 Difficulty to source raw material:</strong>
	For entering a market with a product, an entrepreneur has to identify if
	the suppliers of raw materials and components existing in the market have
	adequate capacity or are willing to expand capacity to meet the
	requirements of a new player in the industry (Porter, 1998). If not, then
	it becomes imperative to establish new suppliers in the market, which may
	be cumbersome for the entrepreneur. Thus, this difficulty to source raw
	materials and components often deters entrepreneurs to enter the market.
