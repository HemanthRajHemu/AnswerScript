			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 7.<h1>Define entrepreneur, Explain the characteristics of an entrepreneur. (8-Marks) (6a)</h1>(June/July 2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
				
				<p>
	The various Definition of Entrepreneur are as follow:
</p>
<p>
	7.1 An individual who bears the risk of operating a business in the face of
uncertainty about the future, conditions.	<strong><h2>- Encyclopedia Britannica.</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	7.2 He is the one who innovates, and introduces something new in the
	economy. <strong><h2>- Joseph A. Schumpeter</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	7.3 He shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area
of higher productivity and greater yield.	<strong><h2>- B. Say (French economist)</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	7.4 He searches for change, responds to it and exploits opportunities.
Innovation is the specific tool of an entrepreneur.	<strong><h2>- Peter F. Drucker</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	7.5 He is the one who is endowed with more than average capacities in the
	task of organising and coordinating the various factors of production. Heis
	a pioneer and captain of industry. <strong><h2>- Francis A. Walker</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	7.6 He is a person who is able to look at the environment, identify
	opportunities to improve the environment, Marshall resources, and implement
	action to maximise those opportunities. - Robert E. Nelson
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2 The Characteristics of an Entrepreneur are as follows:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.1 Creativity:</h2></strong>
	The terms creativity and innovation are often used to mean the same thing,
	but each has a unique connotation. Creativity is "the ability to bring
	something new into existence". This definition emphasises the "ability",
	not the "activity," of bringing something new into existence. A person may
	therefore conceive of something new and envision how it will be useful, but
	not necessarily take the necessary action to make it a reality. Innovation
	is the process of doing new things, but creativity is a prerequisite to
	innovation.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.2 Innovation:</h2></strong>
	Entrepreneurs innovate. Innovation is the specific instrument of
	entrepreneurship. It is the act that resources with a new capacity to
	create wealth. Innovation, indeed, resource Successful entrepreneurs,
	whatever their individual motivation-be it money, power, curiosity, or the
	desire for fame and recognition-try to create value and to make a
	contribution. Still, successful entrepreneurs aim high.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.3 Dynamism</h2></strong>
	: Innovation together with dynamism constitutes a potential combination for
	prosperity. Dynamism revises the targets of the enterprise upwards time and
	again. The enterprise may open up new vistas, better product mix, or
	charismatic product image stimulating steady growth. A dynamic entrepreneur
	is always Pragmatic. Given the potentialities of the enterprises, he sets
	attainable goals, which are to be accomplished within specific timeframes.
	An entrepreneur tends to approach problems to solve them rather than
	running away from them. Being the decision maker, he cannot wish away
	problems,
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.4 Leadership:</h2></strong>
	Leadership is the basic quality of an entrepreneur. This spirit keeps him
	paces forward in any field. Leadership qualities will enable a person to
	stand apart in whatever profession he might be in. The quality of his
	leadership is clear from personal relationships, mode of handling a
	problem, generating resources and taking others in to one's own stride. An
	enterprise endowed with the resource of leadership will always be prominent
	in the market.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.5 Teambuilding:</h2></strong>
	An entrepreneur should have an ability to build a team. A team is a group
	of individuals with a common purpose, that is focused and aligned to
	achieve a specific task or set of outcomes.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.6 Problem solving:</h2></strong>
	It is important that an entrepreneur should be able to solve problems and
	not avoid them. A formal problem-solving model helps entrepreneurs solve
	problems on a logical manner.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.7 Goal orientation:</h2></strong>
	Goal setting is the achievement of targets and objectives for successful
	performance of an entrepreneur, both long run and short run. It helps to
	measure how well individuals and groups are meeting the performance
	standards.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>7.2.8 Long range/short range:</h2></strong>
	An individual/organisation works as much for the future as for the present.
	Each goal, however, has a time dimension. Short range objectives have
	sharper deadlines and are much more planned as their result can be seen in
	the near future. Long-range goals, on the other hand, require perspective
	planning and foresight.<strong><h2></h2></strong>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 8.<h1>Explain the role of entrepreneurs in economic development in India. (8-Marks) (6b)</h1>(June/July 2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
				
				<p>
	Roles of entrepreneurs in economic development in India are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>8.1 Create employment opportunities:</h2></strong>
	By creating a new venture, entrepreneurs generate employment opportunities
	for others. Unemployment is a major issue, especially in the context of
	developing economies like India. Educated youth often are unable to get a
	suitable employment for themselves. Thus, entrepreneurs do a Yeoman's
	service by not only employing themselves into their entrepreneurial
	ventures but also by employing others.
</p>

alt="Roles of entrepreneurs in economic development" class="resIMG"/><br/>
	Fig: Roles of entrepreneurs in economic development
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>8.2 Inspire others towards entrepreneurship:</h2></strong>
	The team created by an entrepreneur for his new venture often provides the
	opportunity for the employees-cum-teammates to have a first-hand experience
	of getting involved in an entrepreneurial venture. This often leads
	eventually for these employees to become entrepreneurs themselves after
	being inspired by their earlier experience of working for an entrepreneur.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>8.3 Create knowledge spill overs</h2></strong>
	: When a scientist, an engineer, or a knowledge worker (i.e., an economic
	agent with endowments of new economic knowledge) leaves an organization to
	create a new firm, knowledge acquired by her in the organization gets
	spilled over to the new firm. Hence, entrepreneurship serves as a mechanism
	by which knowledge spills over to a new firm in which it is commercialized.
	Naturally, the new firm gets benefited by the experience and knowledge
	gained by the founder in her erstwhile organisation.<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>8.4 Augment the number of enterprises:</h2></strong>
	When new firms are created by entrepreneurs, the number of enterprises
	based upon new ideas/concepts/products in a region (say, a city, state, or
	country) increases. Not only does an increase in the number of firms
	enhance the competition for new ideas, but greater competition across firms
	also facilitates the entry of new firms specializing in a particular new
	product niche. This is because the necessary complementary inputs are more
	likely available from small specialist niche firms than from large,
	vertically integrated producers.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>8.5 Provide diversity in firms:</h2></strong>
	Entrepreneurial activity in a region often results into creation of a
	variety of firms in a region. These firms operate into diverse activities
	and it has been found that it is this diversity in firms which fosters
	economic development and growth rather than homogeneity. According to
	Jacobs (1969), it is the exchange of complementary knowledge across diverse
	firms and economic agents that yields an important return on new economic
	knowledge.
