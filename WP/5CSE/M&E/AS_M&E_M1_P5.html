			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p><b>23.1 Interpersonal Roles:</b>
			</p><p><b>23.1.1 Figurehead:</b>
			</p><p>In this role, every manager has to perform some duties of a ceremonial nature, such as greeting the touring dignitaries, attending the wedding of an employee, taking an important customer to lunch, and so on.
			</p><p><b>23.1.2 Leader</b>
			</p><p>As a leader, every manager must motivate and encourage his employees. He must also try to reconcile their a individual needs with the goals of the organisation.
			</p><p><b>23.1.3 Liaison</b>
			</p><p>In this role of liaison, every manager must cultivate contacts outside his vertical chain of command to collect information useful for his organisation.
			</p><hr/><p><b>23.2 Informational Roles</b>
			</p><p><b>23.2.1 Monitor</b>
			</p><p>As a Monitor, the manager has to perpetually scan his environment for information, interrogate his liaison contacts and his subordinates, and receive unsolicited information, much of it as a result of the network of personal contacts he has developed. Through non-work related talks, informal joking around, discussing rumours, hearsay, and the grapevine, politicking, attending external meetings, etc.
			</p><p><b>23.2.2 Disseminator</b>
			</p><p>In the role of a disseminator, the manager passes some of his privileged information directly to his key subordinates who would otherwise have no access to it.
			</p><p><b>23.2.3 Spokesman</b>
			</p><p>A manager is also required nowadays, to spend a part of his time in representing his organisation before various outside groups, which have some stake in the organisation. These Stakeholders can be government officials, labour unions, financial institutions, suppliers, customers, etc.
			</p><hr/><p><b>23.3 Decisional Roles</b>
			</p><p><b>23.3.1 Entrepreneur</b>
			</p><p>In this role, the manager does not merely adapt to his surrounding situation but proactively looks out for innovation to make things happen. Innovation means creating new ideas, Thus, when demand for his product falls off the manager does not cut back his production-but seeks new outlets or new products in order to maintain production.
			</p><p><b>23.3.2 Disturbance Handler</b>
			</p><p>In this role, the manager has to work reactively like a fire fighter. He must seek solutions-of-various unanticipated problems-a strike may loom large, a major customer may go bankrupt, a supplier may renege on his contract, and so on.
			</p><p><b>23.3.3 Resource Allocator</b>
			</p><p>In this who role, the manager must divide work and delegate authority among his subordinates. He must decide who will get what.
			</p><p><b>23.3.4 Negotiator</b>
			</p><p>The manager at all levels has to spend considerable time in negotiations. Thus, the president of a company may negotiate with the union leaders a new strike issue, the foreman may negotiate with the workers a grievance problem, and so on.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			
			<p>A decision is rational if appropriate means are chosen to reach desired ends. 
			</p><p>Following are the seven steps involved in the process of rational decision-making:
			</p><p>i.	Recognising the problem.
			</p><p>ii.	Deciding priorities among problems.
			</p><p>iii.	Diagnosing the problem.
			</p><p>iv.	Developing alternative solutions or courses of action.
			</p><p>v.	Measuring and comparing the consequences of alternative solutions.
			</p><p>vi.	Converting the decision into effective action.
			</p><p>vii.	Follow-up.

			<p><b>25.1 Recognising the Problem:</b>
			</p><p>First of all, it is necessary to search the environment for the existence of a problem. A problem exists if any of the following conditions do occur:
			</p><p><b>25.1.1 When there is a deviation from past experience.</b>
			</p><p><b>25.1.2 When there is a deviation from the plan</b>
			</p><p><b>25.1.3 When other people bring problems to the manager</b>
			</p><p><b>25.1.4 When competitors outperform the manager & organisation</b>
			</p><hr/><p><b>25.2 Deciding Priorities among Problems:</b>
			</p><p>A manager should not allow himself to be bogged down by all sorts of problems. He should set a sequence for them on the basis of strategic considerations. On examination he will find that some of his problems are such which can be solved best not by him but by his subordinates because they are closest to them. All such problems should be passed on to the subordinates. Then, some problems may need to be referred upward because they affect other departments or require information available only at a higher level. Some problems may be deferred because it may not be the best time to act. For example, in many product development areas, delaying a decision may be advisable until the outcome of anticipated technical breakthrough is known. Some problems may even be procrastinated and allowed to be solved without any effort.
			</p><hr/><p><b>25.3 Diagnosing the Problem</b>
			</p><p>How can a manager make sure that he has correctly diagnosed the problem? Unfortunately, there is NO simple answer. The same problem may be looked at differently by different individuals having different background orientations and trainings. However, one thing which can be said for certain is that manager should work through all possible ramifications. He should follow the systems approach in diagnosing a problem. He must make a thorough study of all the sub-parts of his organisation which are connected with the sub-part in which the problem seems to be located. In other words, he must explicitly recognise that the boundaries of a decision problem are not necessarily identical to formal organisational boundaries.
			</p><hr/><p><b>25.4 Developing Alternative Solutions or Courses of Action</b>
			</p><p>After having diagnosed the problem, the next step is to develop alternative. Generally, for every problem there are alternative solutions. In fact, if there seems to be only one way of doing a thing that way is probably wrong. In other words, in every course of action alternatives exist. For instance, if a factory manager is considering a proposal to raise production to meet increased demand, there are several alternatives which can be considered. These might be:(i) build a new plant, or (ii) buy better equipment, or (iii) add an extra shift, or (iv) authorise overtime. Similarly, if he is considering the proposal to be a product leader, there are at least two alternatives which can be considered.
			</p><hr/>

			<p><b>25.5 Measuring and Comparing the Consequences of Alternative Solutions</b>
			</p><p>Once appropriate alternative solutions have been developed, the next step in decision-making Is to measure and compare their consequences. This involves a comparison of the quality and acceptability of various solutions. The quality of a solution must be determined after taking into account its tangible and intangible consequences. Tangible consequences are those which can be quantitatively measured or mathematically demonstrated. For example, one can easily calculate the costs of the various alternatives to meet rising demand in the foregoing example and compare the results. If analysis shows that the demand is only temporary, it would not be worthwhile to build a new plant or even to purchase new equipment. Thus adding a second shift or authorising overtime might be the most profitable course. Using overtime would have the advantage of making an immediate increase in production possible, although it would, of course, require extra labour costs and this would have to be taken into account. Intangible consequences are those which cannot be quantitatively measured or mathematically demonstrated. For example, one cannot easily calculate and compare the effects of good labour relations in one industrial location against low local taxes in another or of selecting a supplier with a lower price proposal against another with a better reputation for meeting delivery promises. One must then use his Judgement and intuition to solve the problem. There is nothing wrong in relying on one's judgement in such a situation. On the contrary, it is harmful to manufacture data to facilitate some calculations.
<hr/>
			</p><p><b>25.6 Converting the Decision into Effective Action</b>
			</p><p>The next step is to translate the decision into action. A decision is not complete until someone has been assigned responsibility to carry it out. This requires the communication of decision to the employees in clear and unambiguous terms. Failure to inform everyone who needs to know of the decision can lead to unfortunate results. Consider the problem of a food company that decided to launch an extensive promotional campaign on one of its speciality items. The management carefully prepared the sales force and had newspaper, magazine and television advertisements ready. However, they did not properly inform the production group. As a result, sufficient amounts of the product were not available to take full advantage of the increased demand generated by the promotional campaign. By the time production rates could be increased, much of the potential benefit of the campaign was lost.
<hr/>
			</p><p><b>25.7 Follow-up of Action</b>
			</p><p>In the final step, the action should be continuously followed up, to ensure Whether the decision is achieving its desired purpose and whether the forecasts and assumptions upon which the decision was based are still valid. Changing conditions necessitate new decisions and the process begins again.
			</p><hr/><p>Herbert A. Simon compresses the above steps into four principal stages: intelligence - searching the  environment for conditions calling for decisions; design-inventing, developing, and analysing possible courses of action; choice-selecting a particular course of action from the available alternatives; and review-assessing past choices.
