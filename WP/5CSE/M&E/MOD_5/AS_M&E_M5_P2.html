			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
		
			<p>Microsoft is a multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services related to computing. The history of Microsoft began on April 4, 1975. It was founded byBill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque. Its current best-selling products are the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software.</p>
<p><strong><h2>1 HE ESTABLISHED MICROSOFT, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMPUTER SOFTWARE COMPANY</h2></strong></p>
<p>In January of 1975, while pursuing his studies at&nbsp;<em>Harvard</em>, Bill Gates and his friend&nbsp;<em>Paul Allen</em>&nbsp;read a cover story in&nbsp;<em>Popular Electronics</em>. The story was about a&nbsp;<em>$350 Altair 8800 microcomputer</em>&nbsp;made by a New Mexico based company called&nbsp;<em>MITS</em>. Bill Gates later recalled that at that point they had understood that&nbsp;<em>the price of computers would soon drop to the point that selling software for them would be a profitable business.&nbsp;</em>Gates dropped out of Harvard wanting to be at the forefront of computer software business. He soon co-founded&nbsp;<em>Micro-soft (later named Microsoft)</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>Paul Allen</em>&nbsp;and in over a decade and a half the duo built&nbsp;<em>the most successful software company in the world.</em></p>
<h2>2 HE CO-DEVELOPED THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE BASIC FOR ALTAIR</h2>
<p>Developed in&nbsp;<em>1963</em>,&nbsp;<em>BASIC</em>&nbsp;had become a&nbsp;<em>popular programming languag</em>e in a few years, owing to the fact that it was easy to learn for beginners but had the necessary functionality that could be stretched by advanced coders. In the 1970s<em>&nbsp;</em>MITS<em>&nbsp;</em>had come out with their&nbsp;<em>Altair 8800 microcomputer machine</em>. Paul Allen and Bill Gates contacted MITS founder&nbsp;<em>Ed Roberts</em>&nbsp;telling him that they were developing an interpreter, and asked whether he would like to see a demonstration in a few weeks. What was of interest was that the duo had announced a non-existent product to gauge interest of the buyer.&nbsp;<em>They neither had an interpreter and not even an Altair system on which to develop and test.</em>&nbsp;The code was finally&nbsp;<em>sold in 1975</em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>$3000</em>&nbsp;to MITS; and Bill and Paul were&nbsp;<em>also hired to maintain and improve it</em>. Many versions like&nbsp;<em>4K BASIC, Extended BASIC</em>&nbsp;would follow and would spark&nbsp;<em>the home computing market of the 1980s</em>, appearing on computers like the&nbsp;<em>IBM PC</em>&nbsp;and the<em>&nbsp;Apple II</em>. BASIC interpreters&nbsp;<em>remained the core of Microsoft&rsquo;s business until the early 1980s</em>, when it shifted to&nbsp;<em>MS-DOS.</em></p>
<h2>3 HE MADE THE PC DOS OPERATING SYSTEM DEAL WITH IBM</h2>
<p>In 1981,&nbsp;<em>International Business Machines (IBM)</em>, one of the world&rsquo;s largest companies having a&nbsp;<em>62% share of the mainframe computer market</em>, was planning to enter the personal computer market. At this time IBM was in touch with Bill Gates and Microsoft, which was the&nbsp;<em>largest producer of computer programming languages with its interpreted BASIC.&nbsp;</em>In 1980, Microsoft was not into the business of operating systems (OS) and most personal computers used&nbsp;<em>Digital Research Inc.&rsquo;s (DRI&rsquo;s) CP/M</em>&nbsp;as an<em>&nbsp;OS</em>. As fate would have it, IBM&rsquo;s deal with DRI went poorly and Bill took the opportunity to become the&nbsp;<em>exclusive licensing agent of 86 DOS or Q-DOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System)</em>, a software similar to CP/M. Microsoft then delivered it to IBM as&nbsp;<em>PC DOS or MS DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)</em>. It would turn out to be&nbsp;<em>a hugely favorable deal&nbsp;</em>as Bill Gates, foreseeing that other hardware vendors would soon clone IBM&rsquo;s system,&nbsp;<em>did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM</em>. As a result there was a rapid growth of licenses for MS-DOS, as software developers quickly moved to become compatible with IBM. By the early 1990s,&nbsp;<em>Microsoft had sold more than one hundred million copies of MS-DOS making it one of the most successful software ever written.</em></p>
<h2>4 HE WAS NAMED AS THE WORLD&rsquo;S YOUNGEST SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE AT 31</h2>
<p>In the&nbsp;<em>1987 issue of the Forbes magazine</em>, Bill Gates was listed&nbsp;<em>among the 400 richest people in America</em>. He was estimated to be worth&nbsp;<em>$1.25 billion</em>&nbsp;and was&nbsp;<em>the world&rsquo;s youngest self-made billionaire to be recognized by the magazine.</em>&nbsp;He was&nbsp;<em>31 years&nbsp;old</em>. The honor would be later held by Facebook founder&nbsp;<em>Mark Zuckerberg</em>&nbsp;at the age of&nbsp;<em>23</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>2008.</em></p>
<h2>5 HIS COMPANY CAME UP WITH WINDOWS 95</h2>
<p>Although MS DOS had established Bill Gates&rsquo;s Microsoft among the most successful and leading companies in the technology revolution, they were yet to give their finest and biggest offering &ndash;&nbsp;<em>Windows</em>. It was arguably the&nbsp;<em>game-changer</em>&nbsp;in personal computer software. Windows 95 was released to enthusiastic customers in the August of 1995 and turned out to be&nbsp;<em>the operating system (OS) that changed everything.</em>&nbsp;Windows is currently installed in high majority of computers (some estimating it&nbsp;<em>close to 90 percent</em>) in the world. It powers many things ranging from business servers and mobile phones to retail displays and cash machines.&nbsp;<em>Windows 1.0</em>&nbsp;was originally a<em>&nbsp;graphical version of MS DOS&nbsp;</em>as a competition against&nbsp;<em>Apple&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lisa&rsquo;</em>. Inspired by the advances in the Xerox&nbsp;<em>PARC</em>, Windows 95 gave the most commercially successful version of a GUI using the&nbsp;<em>WIMP</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;window, icon, menu and pointing device&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;paradigm with revolutionary features like&nbsp;<em>plug and play</em>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;multitasking</em></p>
<h2>6 BILL GATES BECAME THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD AT THE AGE OF 39</h2>
<p>Riding the success of MS DOS and his other successful software during the PC revolution Bill Gates was&nbsp;<em>named the richest man in the world at the age of 39</em>&nbsp;in<em>&nbsp;1995&nbsp;</em>by&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>. He would be consistently ranked among the richest of the rich by the magazine till date; also topping the list in&nbsp;<em>1996</em>,&nbsp;<em>1998 to 2007, 2009&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;2014 to 2017</em>. In 1999 Gates was estimated to be worth&nbsp;<em>$101 billion</em>, there were reports that in 1996 when the company&rsquo;s stocks hit a high, he was&nbsp;<em>earning close to $30 million a day</em>. In 2018 Bill Gates is ranked behind&nbsp;<em>Amazon&rsquo;s Jeff Bezos</em>&nbsp;as the second richest man in the world. He is valued at&nbsp;<em>$90 billion</em>.</p>
<h2>7 HE DID NOTABLE CHARITY WORK THROUGH BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>Established in 1994 as&nbsp;<em>William H. Gates Foundation</em>, his foundation was later relaunched as the&nbsp;<em>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>2000</em>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<em>combining 3 family foundations</em>&nbsp;and Gates&nbsp;<em>donating stocks valued at $5 billion</em>. The foundation aims at&nbsp;<em>improving healthcare, expanding education opportunities&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;reducing extreme poverty</em>. It is considered&nbsp;<em>among the largest and most notable private foundation in the World holding close to $50 billion in assets.&nbsp;</em>Organized through its Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, Global Policy &amp; Advocacy Division and Global Growth &amp; Opportunity Division the foundation has made&nbsp;<em>many notable donations since its inception which run into tens of billions of dollars</em>. Notable recipients include the&nbsp;<em>GAVI Alliance</em>&nbsp;(formerly the&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization&rdquo;</em>),&nbsp;<em>WHO</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Rotatory Foundation of Rotatory International</em>,&nbsp;<em>Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, PATH&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;John Hopkins University</em></p>
<h2>8 GATES IS AMONG THE PIONEERS OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER REVOLUTION</h2>
<p>It is perhaps very difficult to imagine our lives and work without the personal computer in the past few decades. In the 1970&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s, computers were not as common as they are today. It was a time when the idea of personal home computer was mocked by many. The tech revolution required better machines, better technologies, better software but most importantly making things simpler. The PC would do exactly that and make the computer&nbsp;<em>personal with user friendly tools or software like Windows, Office, Paint and many others.&nbsp;</em>Thus computing, which was remote and foreign to most people, would become a personal and easy experience. Establishing Microsoft in the early days of microcomputers, its founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen dreamt of putting a PC on every desk and every home. A dream that would propel a small company of just 30 people to a multi-billion global force that&nbsp;<em>employs 124,000 individuals</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>affects&nbsp;millions of lives as the leading software company in the world;</em>&nbsp;and Bill Gates has been a<em>&nbsp;pioneer of this change.</em></p>
<h2>9 HE IMPACTED THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS</h2>
<p>More than 4 decades after his dream of &lsquo;<em>a PC on every desk</em>&rsquo;,&nbsp;<em>more than a billion&nbsp;PCs&nbsp;are in use today</em>. Microsoft platform has become&nbsp;<em>a target of a massive community of developers which&nbsp;have&nbsp;supplied windows with 16 million programs</em>.&nbsp;<em>Most world business run on Microsoft based IT infrastructure</em>&nbsp;including Windows, Ms Office, Azure cloud services, Skype and more. Microsoft tools are also&nbsp;<em>preferred by many governments around the world</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>they also play important roles in the educational institutions around the world.</em></p>
<h2>10 HE WON THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM IN 2016</h2>
<p>Bill Gates has been honored and recognized throughout his eminent career in the software industry and as a&nbsp;<em>philanthropist</em>. In 2016,&nbsp;<em>Bill and Melinda Gates</em>&nbsp;were awarded the&nbsp;<em>Presidential Medal of Freedom</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<em>President Barack Obama</em>, which is the&nbsp;<em>highest civilian award in the United States</em>. Other notable awards given to Gates include the National Medal of Technology and Innovation (1992); 20th Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS, 1994); Satellite Special Achievement Award for Outstanding Contribution to Entertainment New Media (1997); Bower Award for Business Leadership (2010); Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America (2010); Padma Bhushan (2015), India&rsquo;s third highest civilian honor; and Legion of Honour (2017), the highest national award in France. Bill Gates was also named by the Time magazine as&nbsp;<em>among the 100 most influential people of the 20th century</em></p>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 9<h1>Explain any four roles or importance of Small Scale Industries (SSI) in economic development. (8-Marks) (7a)</h1>(Dec.2018/Jan.2019| EC)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>The following are some specific roles that SSIs play in the Indian economy:</p>
<h3> i. <strong><h2>SSI Increases Production:</h2></strong></h3>
<p>India is one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economies in the world. Consequently, its production output is massive. It is pertinent to note that SSIs contribute almost 40% of India&rsquo;s gross industrial value.</p>
<p>These industries produce goods and services worth over Rs. 40 lakhs for every investment of Rs. 10 lakhs. Furthermore, the value addition in this output increases by over 10%.</p>
<p>Here is another interesting statistic about Small scale industries. The number of Small Scale Industries in India increased from around 8 lakhs in 1980 to over 30 lakhs in 2000.</p>
<p>This figure has grown even more in recent years owing to the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ease of Doing Business&rsquo; policies.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the total industrial production output rose tremendously in the last few years. SSIs are, therefore, strongly responsible for the growth of India&rsquo;s&nbsp;economy.</p>
<h3> II. <strong><h2>SSI Increases Export</h2></strong></h3>
<p>Apart from producing more goods and services, SSIs have been able to export them in large numbers as well.</p>
<p>Almost half of India&rsquo;s total exports these days come from small-scale businesses.</p>
<p>35% of the total exports account for direct exports by SSIs, while indirect exports amount to 15%.</p>
<p>Even trading houses and merchants help SSIs export their goods and services to foreign countries.</p>
<h3>III. <strong><h2>SSI Improves Employment Rate</h2></strong></h3>
<p>It is important to note firstly that Small Scale Industries employs more people than all industries after agriculture.</p>
<p>Almost four persons can get full employment if Rs. 10 lakhs are invested in fixed assets of small-scale sectors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SSIs employ people in urban as well as rural areas.</p>
<p>Consequently, this distributes employment patterns in all parts of the country and prevents unemployment crisis.</p>
<h3>IV. <strong><h2>SSI Open New Opportunities</h2></strong></h3>
<p>Small-scale industries offer several advantages and opportunities for investments.</p>
<p>For example, they receive many tax benefits and rebates from the government. The opportunity to earn profits from SSIs are big due to many reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, SSIs are less capital intensive. They even receive financial support and funding easily.</p>
<p>Secondly, procuring manpower and raw materials is also relatively easier for them. Even the government&rsquo;s export policies favour them heavily.</p>
<h3> V. <strong><h2>SSI Advances Welfare</h2></strong></h3>
<p>Apart from providing profitable opportunities, Small Scale Industries play a large role in advancing welfare measures in the Indian economy as well.</p>
<p>A large number of poor and marginalized sections of the population depend on them for their sustenance.</p>
<p>These industries not only reduce poverty and income inequality but they also raise standards of living of poor people. Furthermore, they enable people to make a living with dignity.</p>
