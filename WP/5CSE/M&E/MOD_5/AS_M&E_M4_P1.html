			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>What are the different types of patents? Explain. (6-Marks) (9b)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>There are three types of Patents granted:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li><strong>Utility Patent</strong>-&nbsp;This is the most important type of Patent it is granted on the functional aspect of the invention. This type of Patent is most sought after and requires a lot of skill in drafting of the application and prosecuting it before a Patent Office. The functional utility of the invention is protected.</li>
<li><strong>Design Patent&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;This type of Patent is granted to the ornamental or external appearance of the invention. If a design is of functional necessity, then it cannot be registered for Design Patent. For e.g the aerodynamic shape of a plane cannot be registered as design patent, as the shape is very important for the smooth functioning of the invention itself.</li>
<li><strong>Plant Patent</strong>-&nbsp;This type of Patent is granted for Plant variety made through asexual reproduction of plant varieties. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A Patent contains following things: &nbsp;-</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Title of the invention this is the description of the invention by the inventor himself.</li>
<li>Cross-reference to related applications, if there are any invention which are found to be closely related&nbsp;to the subject matter under application for grant of Patent.</li>
<li>Background of the invention, this is very important part of an invention as it helps the patent examiner to ascertain what was the prevailing problem in the particular state of the art, which led to the invention. So a lot of importance should be given as it makes a lot easier, practical and narrows the spectrum of the examiner, who need not have to waste his time and resources in ascertaining the</li>
<li>Specification it includes Abstract, description, drawings and claims</li>
<li>Abstract this is brief description of the invention and should not exceed&nbsp;more than 150 words according to Patent Rules, 2003.</li>
<li>Claim(s) this is a techno-legal part of the Patent and hence most important part, as claims define the scope of invention. It is a unilateral statement made by inventor in his own words to set boundaries for his patent. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Drawings are integral part that gives a visual description of the invention and often required by the Comptroller.</li>
<li>Description of the invention sought to be protected is an important perquisite of grant of Patent. &nbsp;There is no hard and fast rule as to what a description should contain but it should contain as much information as would require a person skilled in prior art to make that invention as directed.&nbsp;</li>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>Briefly explain about trademarks in IPR. (10-Marks) (10a)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p><strong>Trademarks:</strong> A trademark protects a symbol, word, or design, used individually or in combination, to indicate the source of goods and to distinguish them from goods produced by others. For example, Apple Computer uses a picture of an apple with a bite out of it and the symbol (&reg;) which means registered trademark. A service mark similarly identifies the source of a service. Trademarks and service marks give a businessthe right to prevent others from using a confusingly similar mark.</p>
<p>In most countries, trademarks must be registered to be enforceable and renewed to remain in force. However, they can be renewed endlessly, Consumers use marks to find a specific firm&rsquo;s goods that they see as particularly desirable &mdash; for example, Barbie dolls or Toyota automobiles. Unlike copyrights or patents, which expire, many business&rsquo;s trademarks become more valuable over time.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;trademark&nbsp;(also written&nbsp;trade mark&nbsp;or&nbsp;trade-mark) is a type of&nbsp;intellectual property&nbsp;consisting of a recognizable&nbsp;sign,&nbsp;design, or&nbsp;expression&nbsp;which identifies&nbsp;products&nbsp;or&nbsp;services&nbsp;of a particular source from those of others,&nbsp;although trademarks used to identify services are usually called&nbsp;service marks.&nbsp;The trademark owner can be an individual,&nbsp;business organization, or any&nbsp;legal entity. A trademark may be located on a&nbsp;package, a&nbsp;label, a&nbsp;voucher, or on the product itself. For the sake of&nbsp;corporate identity, trademarks are often displayed on company buildings. It is legally recognized as a type of&nbsp;intellectual property.</p>
<p>A trademark identifies the&nbsp;brand&nbsp;owner of a particular product or service. Trademarks can be used by others under licensing agreements; for example,&nbsp;Bullyland&nbsp;obtained a license to produce&nbsp;Smurf&nbsp;figurines;&nbsp;the Lego Group&nbsp;purchased a license from&nbsp;Lucasfilm&nbsp;in order to be allowed to launch&nbsp;Lego Star Wars;&nbsp;TT Toys Toys&nbsp;is a manufacturer of licensed ride-on replica cars for children.&nbsp;The unauthorized usage of trademarks by producing and trading&nbsp;counterfeit consumer goods&nbsp;is known as&nbsp;brand piracy.</p>
<p>The owner of a trademark may pursue&nbsp;legal action&nbsp;against&nbsp;trademark infringement. Most countries require formal registration of a trademark as a precondition for pursuing this type of action. The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action can be taken to protect an unregistered trademark if it is in use. Still, common law trademarks offer the holder, in general, less legal protection than registered trademarks.</p>

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 4<h1>Write a note on N. R. Narayana Murthy. (6-Marks) (10b)</h1>(Dec.2017/Jan.2018)</a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy commonly referred to as N. R. Narayana Murthy (Born 20 August 1946) is an Indian IT industrialist and (EX.) Chairman and CEO if Infosys Technologies Ltd. He is a son of a teacher and comes from a middle-class background, he studied well and qualified for the prestigious IIT but couldn't afford it and therefore, went to NIE, Mysore &mdash;a local college for a degree in electrical engineering. After completion of his degree he took up a job in Kanpur in 1969. In his life, he always used to take risk-taking decisions. The following risk-taking decisions he made are:</p>
<p>1) Murthy Pursued a career in computer science when there were not too many jobs in this field. The Indian business was very much into mortar-bricks and had just begun to appreciate the role of computer.</p>
<p>2) The next risk he took was to turn down attractive offers from large companies such as Telco, HMT and Air India; instead he joined as a system programmer at IIMA located in Ahmedabad were beginning to install HP minicomputers and was forging ahead to become the second business school after Stanford to have time-sharing operating system. This gave this thrill in the job and was the main reason for Murthy to join the team at IIMA under J.G. Krishnayya, Prof. of Information systems. Murthy later receiver a salary of 800 Rupees per month.</p>
<p>3) A got a chance from Sesa, a French software company, to build an operating system to handle air cargo at the Charles de Gaulle airport located in Paris but at the same time he also received a scholarship to pursue a Ph. D. in USA and Israel. But Murthy instead went to Paris to master another Language-French. After completion of his project he came back to pune in 1974 to join his mentor Prof. J. G. Krishnayya who was setting up the system Research Institute (non-Profit organization). Having worked for some time he became frustrated with his work he later took up a job in Patni Computer Systems (Mumbai Based firm). At PCS, he was head of software group and here he met some of the would-be founder-partners of Infosys. He later quit the job and started his software service with his partners. This was the firm which was to become the giant that Infosys is today. His partners were all middleclass backgrounds and pooled in 10,000 rupees capital borrowed from tier better half. In this way, Infosys Consultants was born in July 1981 in one bedroom of two bedroom apartment in pune.</p>
<p>4) The first ten years after 1981 were quite tough for Murthy and his team it took them | year to get telephone; it took them 2 years to get a license to import a computer; . His wife Sudha had to go and live with her parents for a year. In 1990, his partners thought of selling the company. But Murthy differed and even offered to buy his partners out.</p>
<p><strong>Childhood &amp; Early Life</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>He was born on 20 August 1946, in Sidlaghatta, Karnataka, in a middle-class family.</li>
<li>His uncle was a civil servant and Narayana&rsquo;s father wanted him to follow the same route. But the young boy had other plans; he wanted to be an engineer as that was the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing in India in those days.</li>
<li>He appeared for the entrance test for the India Institute of Technology (IIT) after completing his schooling and cleared it with a high rank and a scholarship. However the scholarship was not enough to completely cover his educational expenses and his father could not afford to pay the fees.</li>

This influenced Narayana to pursue a career in the IT sector in future.</li>
<li>He was flooded with job offers on completion of his course as at that time there were just a few computer science graduates in India. He had job offers from HMT, Telco and Air India, all of them offering high salaries.</li>

<li>He worked overseas in the 1970s, and the years he spent in Paris had a deep influence on him. Initially a staunch leftist who supported Communism, he eventually changed his views and concluded that compassionate capitalism and the large-scale creation of jobs was the only practical method of eradicating poverty.</li>
