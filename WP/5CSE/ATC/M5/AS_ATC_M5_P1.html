			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript1')">Question 1 A<h1>Write short notes on: <br/>
			Multi-tape Turing machine.
			</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	A multi-tape Turing Machine is nothing but a standard Turing Machine with
	more number of tapes. Each tape is controlled independently with
	independent read-write head. The pictorial representation of mulu-tape
	Turing machine is shown in figure below:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/ATC/M5/ATC_M5_IMG/1.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	The various components of multi-tape Turing Machine are:
</p>
<p>
	a) Finite control.
</p>
<p>
	b) Each tape having its own symbols and read/write head.
</p>
<p>
	Each tape is divided into cells which can hold any symbol from the given
	alphabet. To start with the TM should be in start state q<sub>0</sub>. If
	the read/write head pointing to tape 1 moves towards night, the read/write
	head pointing to tape 2 and tape 3 may move towards right or left depending
	on the transition. The formal definition of Multi-tape Turing machine can
	be defined as follows.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/ATC/M5/ATC_M5_IMG/1.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	Where q is the current state. The transition can be interpreted as follows.
	The TM instate q will be moved to state p only when the first read/write
	head points to a, the second read-write head points to b and third
	read/write head points to c and the read/write head will be moved to left
	in the first case and right in the second case. But, the read/write head
	with respect to third tape will not be altered. At the same time, the
	symbols a, b and c will be replaced by x, y and z. It can be easily shown
	that the n-tape TM in fact is equivalent to the single tape Standard Turing
	Machine as shown below.
</p>
<p>
	1.a.1 Equivalence of Single Tape and Multi-tape TM's
</p>
<p>
	Theorem: Every language accepted by a multi-tape TM Is recursively
	enumerable.
</p>
<p>
	Note: The theorem clearly indicates that every language accepted by a
	multi-tape TM is also accepted by a standard TM.
</p>
<p>
	Proof: This can be shown by simulation. For example, consider a TM with two
	tapes as shown below:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/ATC/M5/ATC_M5_IMG/1.3.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	The above 2-tape TMcan be simulated using single tape TM which hasfour
	tracks as shown in figure below:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/ATC/M5/ATC_M5_IMG/1.4.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	The first and third tracks consist of symbols from first and second tape
	respectively. The second and fourth track consists of the positions of the
	read/write head with respect to first and second tape respectively. The
	value 1 indicates the position of the read/write head. It is clear from the
	above figure that, the machine in state q and when the first read/write
	head points to the symbol c, the second read/write head points to the
	symbol z, then the machine enters into state p, if and only if this
	transition is defined for TM with multi-tapes. So, whatever transitions
	have been applied for multi-tape TM, if we apply the same transitions for
	the new machine that we have constructed, then the two machines are
	equivalent.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 1 B<h1>Write short notes on: <br/>
			Non-deterministic Turing machine.
			</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	The difference between nondeterministic TM and deterministic TM lies only
	in the definition of &#61700;. The formal definition of nondeterministic TM
	is shown below:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/ATC/M5/ATC_M5_IMG/1.5.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	The language is thus set of all those words w in &#931; which causes M to
	move from start state q<sub>0</sub> to the final state p.
</p>
<p>
	A nondeterministic TM may have many moves that does not lead to a final
	state. But, we are interested in only those moves that leads to the final
	states. The nondeterministic TM in fact is no more powerful than the
	deterministic TM. Any language accepted by nondeterministic TM can be
	accepted by deterministic and both are equivalent. We can simulate a
	deterministic TM from a nondeterministic TM as shown below:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Theorem:</strong>
	For every nondeterministic TM (NTM)there exists a deterministic TM (DTM)
	such that LO(NTM) = L(DTM).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Proof:</strong>
	Given a string w, NTM starts at the initial configuration (initial ID) and
	goes through a sequence of configurations(IDs) until it reaches one of the
	conditions:
</p>
<p>
	i. Final state is reached and the machine halts
</p>
<p>
	ii. The transition is not defined and the machine halts
</p>
<p>
	iii. Goes into an infinite loop
</p>
<p>
	To go to the next configuration (ID), the NTM has to choose from finite set
	of configurations (IDs). All these configurations (IDs) which can be
	obtained by NTM fora given string w can be represented by a tree. The way
	NTM is simulated by DTM is shown using the figure shown below:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/ATC/M5/ATC_M5_IMG/1.6.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center>
<p>
	It is clear from the figure that all the IDs of NTM (represented by the
	nodes of the tree) are placed in the queue one after the other. Each ID
	inserted into the queue is also associated with the state and the next
	input symbol to be scanned. The first ID to be explored and examined will
	be at the front end of the queue. Given any ID in the queue, all IDs to the
	left of designated ID are assumed to be deleted (marked) and the IDs
	towards right are assumed to be explored or to be examined. For example, if
	current ID is ID3 then JD1 and [D2 are already explored and we need not
	consider them whereas the ID4, IDS, etc., are the nodes to be explored
	later. The steps carried by DTM are shown below:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Step 1:</strong>
	The current ID is examined (For the first time current ID is [D1 and is
	marked/deleted) based on the state and the scanned symbol. If the state in
	the current ID is final state then DTM accepts the string and the machine
	halts.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Step 2:</strong>
	If the state is non final state, the current ID(configuration) is explored
	and various IDs(configurations) obtained are inserted at the end of the
	queue.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Step 3:</strong>
	Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until no more ID is examined or queue is empty.
</p>
<p>
	The above steps can be clearly explained using the tree representation. The
	root node corresponds to the initial configuration (initial ID) and it is
	the only vertex of level 0. All the configurations (IDs) that are obtained
	by applying the transition function of NTM only once will be the children
	of the initial configuration (ID), These new vertices which are derived
	from the root are at level 1. In general, from the configurations (IDs) at
	level &#233;, the configurations at level i+1 can be obtained. Since the
	configurations are finite, the number of children at various levels is
	finite.
</p>
<p>
	The easiest way to simulate NTM using DTM is to traverse this tree using
	BFS (Breadth First-Search) from the root until the halt state (the string w
	is accepted or rejected) is reached. At each level of the tree, the DTM
	applies the transition function corresponding to the NTM to each
	configuration (ID) at that level and computes its children (new IDs). These
	new IDs are the configurations of the next level and they are stored on the
	tape (if necessary a second tape may be used). If there is a halting state
	among these children, then DTM accepts the string and halts. It can be
	easily seen that DTM accepts a string if and only if NTM accepts it. Thus
	any language accepted by a NTM is also accepted by a DTM.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	<strong>Definition:</strong>
	The problems that run forever on a Turing machine are not solvable. In
	other words, there are some problem input instances for which Turing
	machines will not halt on inputs that they do not accept. Those problems
	are called <strong>unsolvable or undecidable problems</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	In general, if there is no general algorithm capable of solving every
instance of the problem, then the decision problem is	<strong>unsolvable</strong>. More precisely, if there is no Turing machine
	recognizing the language of all strings for various instances of the
	problems input for which the answer is yes or no, then the decision problem
	is unsolvable.
</p>
<p>
	Let us assume M is a Turing machine with input alphabets {0, 1}, w is a
	string of 0's and 1's and M accepts w. If this problem with inputs
	restricted to binary alphabets {0, 1} is undecidable, then the general
	problem is undecidable and cannot be solved with a Turing machine with any
	alphabet.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong>
	The term unsolvable and undecidable are used interchangeably.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong>
	Even though we are able to answer the question in many specific instances,
	a problem may be undecidable. It means that there is no single algorithm
	guaranteed to provide an answer for every case.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong>
	If a language L is not accepted by a Turing machine, then the language is
	not recursively enumerable. One important problem which is not recursively
	enumerable that is unsolvable/undecidable decision problem is "Halting
	problem".

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 2 B<h1>Write short notes on: <br/>
			b.	Halting problem of Turing machine.
			</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	The "<strong>Halting Problem</strong>" can informally be stated as "Given a
Turing machine M and an input string w with the initial configuration q	<sub>0</sub>, after some (or all) computations do the machine M halts?" In
	other words, we have to identify whether (M, w) where M is the Turing
	machine, halts or does not halt when w is applied as the input. The domain
	of this problem is to be taken as the set of all Turing machines and all w
	i.e., Given the description of an arbitrary Turing machine M and the input
	string w, we are looking for a single Turing machine that will predict
	whether or not the computation of M applied to w will halt.
</p>
<p>
	When we state decidability or undecidability results, we must always know
	what the domain is, because this may affect the conclusion. The problems
	may be decidable on some domain but not on another.
</p>
<p>
	It is not possible to find the answer for Halting problem by simulating the
	action of M on w by a universal Turing machine, because there is no limit
	on the length of the computation. If M enters into an infinite loop, then
	no matter how long we wait, we can never be sure that M is in fact in a
	loop. The machine may be in a loop because of a very long computation. What
	is required is an algorithm that can determine the correct answer for any M
	and w by performing some analysis on the machine's description and the
	input.
