			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript1')">Question 1<h1>What are key issues which needs to be addressed by non-monotonic reasoning system? Explain. (6-Marks) (5a)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	we must address several key issues, including the following:
</p>
<p>
	I.
	<strong><h2>
		How can the knowledge base be extended to allow inferences to be made
		on the basis of lack of knowledge as well as on the presence of it?
	</h2></strong>
	For example, we would like to be able to say things like, "H you have no
	reason to suspect that a particular person committed a crime, then assume
	he didn't," or "If you have no reason to believe that someone is not
	getting along with her relatives, then assume that the relatives will try
	to protect her." Specifically, we need to make clear the distinction
	between:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M3/M3_IMG/1.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	First-order predicate logic allows reasoning to be based on the first of
	these. We need an extended system that allows reasoning to be based on the
	second as well. In our new system, we call any inference that depends on
the lack of some piece of knowledge a	<strong><h2>non-monotonic inference</h2></strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Allowing such reasoning has a significant impact on a knowledge base.
	Non-monotonic reasoning systems derive their name from the fact that
	because of inferences that depend on lack of knowledge, knowledge bases may
	not grow monotonically as new assertions are made. Adding a new assertion
	may invalidate an inference that depended on the absence of that assertion.
	First-order predicate logic systems, on the other hand, are monotonic in
	this respect. As new axioms are asserted, new wff's may become provable,
	but no old proofs ever become invalid.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>
		II. How can the knowledge base be updated properly when a new fact is
		added to the system (or when an old one is removed?
	</h2></strong>
	In particular, in non-monotonic systems, since the addition of a fact can
	cause previously discovered proofs to be become invalid, how can those
	proofs, and all the conclusions that depend on them be found? The usual
	solution to this problem is to keep track of proofs, which are often called
	justifications. This makes it possible to find all the justifications that
	depended on the absence of the new fact, and those proofs can be marked as
	invalid. Interestingly, such a recording mechanism also makes it possible
	to support conventional, monotonic reasoning in the case where axioms must
	occasionally be retracted to reflect changes in the world that is being
	modelled.
</p>
<p>
	For example, it may be the case that Abbott is in town this week and so is
	available to testify, but if we wait until next week, he may be out of
	town. As a result, when we discuss techniques for maintaining valid sets of
	justifications, we talk both about non-monotonic reasoning and about
	monotonic reasoning in a changing world.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>III. </h2></strong>
	<strong><h2>
		How can knowledge be used to help resolve conflicts when there are
		several in consistent non-monotonic inferences that could be drawn?
	</h2></strong>
	It turns out that when inferences can be based on the lack of knowledge as
	well as on its presence, contradictions are much more likely to occur than
	they were in conventional logical systems in which the only possible
	contradictions were those that depended on facts that were explicitly
	asserted to be true. In particular, in non-monotonic systems, there are
	often portions of the knowledge base that are locally consistent but
	mutually (globally) inconsistent. As we show below, many techniques for
	reasoning non-monotonically are able to define the alternatives that could
	be believed, but most of them provide no way to choose among the options
	when not all of them can be believed at once.
</p>
<p>
	To do this, we require additional methods for resolving such conflicts in
	ways that are most appropriate for the particular problem that is being
	solved, For example, as soon as we conclude that Abbott, Babbitt, and Cabot
	all claim that they didn't commit a crime, yet we conclude that one of them
	must have since there's no one else who is believed to have had a motive,
	we have a contradiction, which we want to resolve in some particular way
	based on other knowledge that we have.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>Briefly explain the motivation for fuzzy logic. (4-Marks) (5b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	A different approach and briefly consider what happens if we make
	fundamental changes to our idea of set membership and corresponding changes
	to our definitions of logical operations.
</p>
<p>
	The motivation for fuzzy sets is provided by the need to represent such
	propositions as:
				<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M3/M3_IMG/2.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
</p>
<p>
	While traditional set theory defines set membership as a Boolean predicate,
	fuzzy set theory allows us to represent set membership as a possibility
	distribution, for the set of tall people and the set of very tall people.
	Notice how this contrasts with the standard Boolean definition for tall
	people. In the latter, one is either tall or not and there must be a
	specific height that defines the boundary. The same is true for very tall.
	In the former, one's tallness increases with one's height until the value
	of 1 1s reached.
</p>
<p>
	Fuzzy logic is an alternative for representing some kinds of uncertain
	knowledge. Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with
	reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. Compared to
	traditional binary sets (where variables may take on true or false values),
	fuzzy logic variables may have a truth value that ranges in degree between
	0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial
	truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and
	completely false. Fuzzy set theory defines set membership as a possibility
	distribution.
</p>
<p>
	Fuzzy logic is a totally different approach to representing uncertainty:
</p>
<p>
	I. It focuses on ambiguities in describing events rather the uncertainty
	about the occurrence of an event.
</p>
<p>
	II. Changes the definitions of set theory and logic to allow this.
</p>
<p>
	III. Traditional set theory defines set memberships as a boolean predicate.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>Explain how semantic networks are used in representation and reasoning. (6-Marks) (5c)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
    The main idea behind semantic nets is that the meaning of a concept comes
    from the ways in which it is connected to other concepts. In a semantic
    net, information is represented as a set of nodes connected to each other
    by a set of labelled arcs, which represent relationships among the nodes. A
    fragment of a typical semantic net is shown in Fig. 3.1.
</p>

<p align="center">
    Fig 3.1: A Semantic Network
</p>
<p>
    This network contains examples of both the is a and instance relations, as
    well as some other, more domain specific relations like ream and
    uniform-color. In this network, we could use inheritance to derive the
    additional relation

</p>
<p>
    <strong><h2>3.1 </h2></strong>
    <strong><h2>Intersection Search</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
    One of the early ways that semantic nets were used was to find
    relationships among objects by spreading activation out from each of two
    nodes and seeing where the activation met. This process is called
    intersection search. Using this process, it is possible to use the network
    of Fig. 3.1 to answer questions such as "What is the connection between the
    Brooklyn Dodgers and blue?"! This kind of reasoning exploits one of the
    important advantages that slot-and-filler structures have over purely
    logical representations because it takes advantage of the entity-based
    organization of knowledge that slot-and-filler representations provide.
</p>
<p>
    To answer more structured questions, however, requires networks that are
    themselves more highly structured. In the next few sections we expand and
    refine our notion of a network in order to support more sophisticated
    reasoning.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><h2>3.2 </h2></strong>
    <strong><h2>Representing Nonbinary Predicates</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Semantic nets are a natural way to represent relationships that would
    appear as ground instances of binary predicates in predicate logic. For
    example, some of the arcs from Fig. 9.1 could be represented in logic as
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M3/M3_IMG/3.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
    But the knowledge expressed by predicates of other arities can also be
    expressed in semantic nets. We have already seen that many unary predicates
    in logic can be thought of as binary predicates using some very
    general-purpose predicates, such as is a and instance. So, for example,
</p>
<p>
    <strong><h2>man(Marcus) </h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
    could be rewritten as
</p>
<p>
    <strong><h2> instance(Marcus, Man)</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
    thereby making it easy to represent in a semantic net.
</p>
<p>
    Three or more place predicates can also be converted to a binary form by
    creating one new object representing the entire predicate statement and
    then introducing binary predicates to describe the relationship to this new
    object of each of the original arguments. For example, suppose we know that
</p>
<p>
    score(Cubs, Dodgers, 5-3)
</p>
<p>
    This can be represented in a semantic net by creating a node to represent
    the specific game and then relating each of the three pieces of information
    to it. Doing this produces the network shown in Fig. 3.3.
</p>
<p>
    This technique is particularly useful for representing the contents of a
    typical declarative sentence that describes several aspects of a particular
    event. The sentence
</p>
<p>
    John gave the book to Mary.
</p>
<p>
    could be represented by the network shown in Fig. 3.4 In fact, several of
    the earliest uses of semantic nets were in English-understanding programs.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 4<h1>Explain non monotonic logic and default logic with example. Which are the two common kinds of non-monotonic reasoning defined in these logics? (6-Marks) (6a)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	We want to use non-monotonic reasoning to perform what is commonly called
	default reasoning. two approaches to doing this.
</p>
<p>
	I. Nonmonotonic Logic
</p>
<p>
	II. Default Logic
</p>
<p>
	We then describe two common kinds of nonmonotonic reasoning that can be
	defined in those logics:
</p>
<p>
	I. Abduction
</p>
<p>
	II. Inheritance
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>4.1 Nonmonotonic Logic:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	One system that provides a basis for default reasoning is Nonmonotonic
	Logic (NML) [McDermott and Doyle, 1980], in which the language of
	first-order predicate logic is augmented with a modal operator M, which can
	be read as "is consistent."' For example, the formula
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M3/M3_IMG/4.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	should be read as, "For all x and y, if x and y are related and if the fact
	that x gets along with y is consistent with everything else that is
	believed, then conclude that x will defend y."
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>4.2 Default Logic</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	An alternative logic for performing default-based reasoning is Reiter's
	Default Logic (DL) [Reiter, 1980], in which a new class of inference rules
	is introduced. In this approach, we allow inference rules of the form
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M3/M3_IMG/4.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	Such a rule should be read as, "If A is provable and it is consistent to
	assume B then conclude C." As you can see, this is very similar in intent
	to the nonmonotonic expressions that we used in NML. There are some
	important differences between the two theories, however. The first is that
	in DL the new inference miles are used as a basis for computing set of
	plausible extensions to the knowledge base. Each extension corresponds to
	one maximal consistent augmentation of the knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
	The Logic then admits as a theorem any expression that is valid in any
	extension. If a decision among the extensions is necessary to support
	problem solving, some other mechanism must be provided. So, for example, if
	we return to the case of Dick the Republican. we can compute two
	extensions, one corresponding to his being a pacifist and one corresponding
	to his not being a pacifist.
