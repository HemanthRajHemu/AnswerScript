			<p>
	Consider the following set of well-formed formulas in predicate logic:
</p>
<p>
	i. Man(Marcus)
</p>
<p>
	ii. Pompeian (Marcus)
</p>
<p>
	iii. &#8704; x: Pompeian (x) - Roman(x)
</p>
<p>
	iv. Ruler (Caeser) he

<p>
	v. &#8704;x: Roman (x) &#8594; loyalto (x, caeser) v hate (x, caeser)

<p>
	viii. Tryassassinate (Marcus, Caeser).
</p>
<p>
	Convert these into clause form and prove that hate (Marcus, caeser) using
	resolution proof. (10-Marks) (3a)
</p>
			</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	We now have an easy way of determining that two literals are
	contradictory--they are if one of them can be unified with the negation of
	the other, So, for example, man(x) and a man(Spot) are contradictory, since
	man(x) and man(Spot) can be unified. This corresponds to the intuition that
	says that man(x) cannot be true for all x if there is known to be some x,
	say Spot, for which man(x) is false. Thus in order to use resolution for
	expressions in the predicate logic, we use the unification algorithm to
	locate pairs of literals that cancel out.
</p>
<p>
	We also need to use the unifier produced by the unification algorithm to
	generate the resolvent clause. For example, suppose we want to resolve two
	clauses:
</p>

<p>
	to the set of available clauses and begun the resolution process. But
	immediately we notice that there are no clauses that contain a literal
	involving 7hate. Since the resolution process can only generate new clauses
	that are composed of combinations of literals from already existing
	clauses, we know that no such clause can be generated and thus we conclude
	that hate(Marcus,Caesar) will not produce a contradiction with the known
	statements.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>What is "Matching" in rule based system? Briefly explain different proposals for matching. (6-Marks) (3b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p align="center">
	<strong>Matching</strong>
</p>
<p>
	I. Till now we have used search to solve the problems as the application of
	appropriate rules.
</p>
<p>
	II. We applied them to individual problem states to generate new states to
	which the rules can then be applied, until a solution is found.
</p>
<p>
	III. We suggest that a clever search involves choosing from among the rules
	that can be applied at a particular point, but we do not talk about how to
	extract from the entire collection of rules those that can be applied at a
	given point.
</p>
<p>
	IV. Different matching processes are,
</p>
<p>
	A. Indexing
</p>
<p>
	B. Matching with variables
</p>
<p>
	C. Complex and approximate matching Conflict resolution
</p>
<h4>
	Indexing
</h4>
<p>
	I. Do a simple search through all the rules, comparing each one&#8223;s
	precondition to the current state and extracting all the ones that match.
</p>
<p>
	II. But this has two problems
</p>
<p>
	a. In order to solve very interesting problems, it will be necessary to use
	a large number of rules, scanning through all of them at every step of the
	search would be hopelessly inefficient.
</p>
<p>
	b. It is not always immediately obvious whether a rule&#8223;s
	preconditions are satisfied by a particular state.
</p>
<p>
	III. To solve the first problem, use simple indexing. Eg. In Chess, combine
	all moves at a particular board state together.
</p>
<h4>
	Matching with Variables
</h4>
<p>
	I. The problem of selecting applicable rules is made more difficult when
	preconditions are not stated as exact descriptions of particular situations
	but rather describe properties that the situations must have.
</p>
<p>
	II. Then we need to match a particular situation and the preconditions of a
	given situation.
</p>
<p>
	III. In many rules based systems, we need to compute the whole set of rules
	that match the current state description. Backward Chaining Systems usually
	use depth-first backtracking to select individual rules, but forward
	chaining systems use Conflict Resolution Strategies.
</p>
<p>
	One efficient algorithm RETE, which gains efficiency from three major
	sources.
</p>
<h5>
	<strong>1) </strong>
	The temporal nature of data:
</h5>
<p>
	Whenever we apply a rule on the current state. Some properties will be
	added and some other properties are deleted and some times the rule will
	not be applicable. If no rule will not be applicable to the problem, the
	RETE process will tell which rule applicable to the pre-state is not
	applicable to the current state.
</p>
<h5>
	<strong>2) </strong>
	Structural similarities in rules:
</h5>
<p>
	<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	In the similarities of the rules, data can be considered as
</p>
<p>
	i) Tiger(x) &#61663; mammal(x) ^ stripes(x) ^ carnivorous(x)
</p>
<p>
	ii) Jaguar(x)&#61663; mammal(x) ^ sports (x) ^ carnivorous(x)
</p>
<p>
	Ex: For this consider
</p>
<h6>
	Frame-I frame II
</h6>
<p>
	<strong>Similarities similarities</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Mammal(x) stripes(x)
</p>
<p>
	Carnivorous(x) sports(x)
</p>
<p>
	In RETE process , first we have to verify the dissimilarities rules and
	after that we verify the similar rules and also we have to identify which
	rule have less no of sub goals and which rule has more no of sub goals.
</p>
<h5>
	<strong>3) </strong>
	Persistence in binding up of variables:-
</h5>
<p>
There may be variable binding conflicts that prevent the rule from firing.	<em>For example</em>, consider the following facts.
</p>
<p>
	Son (john, David)
</p>
<p>
	Son (bill, Ellen) and we can compare to son(x,y) and son(y,z) The
	individual preconditions of the rule is
</p>
<h6>
	&#61474;x: &#61474;y : son(x, y) ^ son(y, z)&#61664;grandparent(y, z).
</h6>
<p>
	<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Where x=John and y=David.
</p>
<p>
	For this first time, x, y has initial values after the completion of first
	predicate here x,y are binded variables.
</p>
<p>
	For the second time, if y=bill which is not accepted because
	&#8222;y&#8223; has already a value is given. So, we can not give another
	value &#8222;y&#8223;. Therefore, &#8222;y&#8223; is a binding up variable.
	The RETE takes the binding up of variables to the problem solving.
</p>
<h4>
	Complex &amp; Approximate Matching
</h4>
<p>
	I. A more complex matching process is required when the preconditions of a
	rule specify required properties that are not stated explicitly in the
	description of the current state. In this case, a separate set of rules
	must be used to describe how some properties can be inferred from others.
</p>
<p>
	II. An even more complex matching process is required if rules should be
	applied if their preconditions approximately match the current situation.
	Example of listening to a recording of a telephonic conversation.
</p>
<p>
	III. For some problems, almost all the action is in the matching of the
	rules to the problem state. Once that is done, so few rules apply that the
	remaining search is trivial.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Example</strong>
	: ELIZA
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M2/M2_IMG/2.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	The conversion between ELIZA, an A.I problem and the user. Here ELIZA will
	try to match the left side of the rule against the sentence and use the
	correct right side rule to generate a response. Let us considering the
	following ELIZA rules.
</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td width="195" valign="top">
				<p>
					(x me y)
				</p>
			</td>
			<td width="85" valign="top">
				<p align="center">
					&#61664;
				</p>
			</td>
			<td width="255" valign="top">
				<p>
					(X you y)
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="195" valign="top">
				<p>
					(I remember x)
				</p>
			</td>
			<td width="85" valign="top">
				<p>
					&#61664;
				</p>
			</td>
			<td width="255" valign="top">
				<p>
					(Why do remember x just now?)
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="195" valign="top">
				<p>
					(My family -member is y)
				</p>
			</td>
			<td width="85" valign="top">
				<p>
					&#61664;
				</p>
			</td>
			<td width="255" valign="top">
				<p>
					(Who else is your family is y?)
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	Suppose the use say <strong>"I remember Mary". </strong>How ELIZA will try
	to match the above response to the left hand side of the given rules. It
	finds that it matches to the first rule and now it take the right hand side
	ask, <strong>"Why do rememberMary just now?" </strong>This is the why how
	the conversion proceeds taking into consideration the approximate matching.
</p>
<h4>
	Conflict Resolution
</h4>
<p>
	I. The result of the matching process is a list of rules whose antecedents
	have matched the current state description along with whatever variable
	binding were generated by the matching process.
</p>
<p>
	II. It is the job of the search method to decide on the order in which the
	rules will be applied. But sometimes it is useful to incorporate some of
	the decision making into the matching process. This phase is called
	conflict resolution.
</p>
<p>
	III. There are three basic approaches to the problem of conflict resolution
	in the production system
</p>
<p>
	I. Assign a preference based on the rule that matched.
</p>
<p>
	II. Assign a preference based on the objects that matched.
</p>
<p>
	III. Assign a preference based on the action that the matched rule would
	perform.
</p>
<h6>
	a) Preference based on rules:
</h6>
<p>
	a. Here we consider the rule in the order they are given or we given some
	priority
</p>
<p>
	b. to special case rules.
</p>
<h6>
	b) Performance based on object:
</h6>
<p>
	a. Here we use key words to match into the rules. Consider the example of
</p>
<p>
	b. ELIZA.
</p>
<h6>
	c) Performance based on states:
</h6>
<p>
	a. In this case we consider all rules that are waiting, which gives some
	states.
</p>
<p>
	b. Here a heuristic function we can decide which state is the best.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>What are properties of good system for the representation of knowledge? Explain different approaches to knowledge representation. (6-Marks) (4a)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	A good system for the representation of knowledge in a particular domain
	should possess the following four properties:
</p>
<p>
	I. <strong>Representational Adequacy</strong>: the ability to represent
	tall of the kinds of knowledge that are needed in that domain.
</p>
<p>
	II. <strong>Inferential Adequacy:</strong> the ability to manipulate the
	representational structures in such a way as to derive new structures
	corresponding to new knowledge inferred from old.
</p>
<p>
	III. <strong>Inferential Efficiency</strong>: the ability to incorporate
	into the knowledge structure additional information that can be used to
	focus the attention of the inference mecha-nisms in the most promising
	directions.
</p>
<p>
	IV. <strong>Acquisitional Efficiency:</strong> the ability to acquire new
	information easily. The simplest case involves direct insertion, by a
	person, of new knowledge into the database. Ideally, the program itself
	would be able to control knowledge acquisition.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, no single system that optimizes all of the capabilities for
	all kinds of knowledge has yet been found. As a result, multiple techniques
	for knowledge representation exist. Many programs rely on more than one
	technique. In the chapters that follow, the most important of these
	techniques are described in detail. But in this section, we provide a
	simple, example-based introduction to the important ideas.
</p>
<p>
	The Different Approaches to Knowledge Representation (KR) are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	a. Simple Relational Knowledge
</p>
<p>
	b. Inheritable Knowledge
</p>
<p>
	c. Inferential Knowledge
</p>
<p>
	d. Procedural Knowledge
</p>
<p>
	<strong> I. </strong>
	<strong>Simple Relational Knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The simplest way to represent declarative facts is as a set of relations of
	the same sort used in database systems.
</p>
<p>
	Figure 3.1 shows an example of such a relational system.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M2/M2_IMG/3.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig 3.1: Simple Relational Knowledge and a sample fact in Prolog
</p>
<p>
	The reason that this representation is simple is that standing alone it
	provides very weak inferential capabilities. But knowledge represented in
	this form may serve as the input to more powerful inference engines.
</p>
<p>
	For example, given just the facts of Fig.3.1, it is not possible even to
	answer the simple question, "Who is the heaviest player?" But if a
	procedure for finding the heaviest player is provided, then these facts
	will enable the procedure to compute an answer. If, instead, we are
	provided with a set of rules for deciding which hitter to put up against a
	given pitcher (based on right- and left-handedness, say), then this same
	relation can provide at least some of the information required by those
	rules.
</p>
<p>
	Providing support for relational knowledge is what database systems are
	designed to do. Thus we do not need to discuss this kind of knowledge
	representation structure further here. The practical issues that arise in
	linking a database system that provides this kind of support to a knowledge
	representation system that provides some of the other capabilities that we
	are about to discuss have already been solved in several commercial
	products.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>II. </strong>
	<strong>Inheritable Knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>
	a. In the inheritable knowledge approach, all data must be stored into a
	hierarchy of classes.
</p>
<p>
	b. All classes should be arranged in a generalized form or a hierarchal
	manner.
</p>
<p>
	c. In this approach, we apply inheritance property.
</p>
<p>
	d. Elements inherit values from other members of a class.
</p>
<p>
	e. This approach contains inheritable knowledge which shows a relation
	between instance and class, and it is called instance relation.
</p>
<p>
	f. Every individual frame can represent the collection of attributes and
	its value.
</p>
<p>
	g. In this approach, objects and values are represented in Boxed nodes.
</p>
<p>
	h. We use Arrows which point from objects to their values.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M2/M2_IMG/3.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig 3.2: Inheritance KR
</p>
<p>
	<strong>III. </strong>
	<strong>Inferential Knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Property inheritance is a powerful form of inference, but it is not the
	only useful form. Sometimes all the power of traditional logic (and
	sometimes even more than that} is necessary to describe the inferences that
	are needed.
</p>
<p>
	Figure 3.3 shows two examples of the use of first-order predicate logic to
	represent additional! knowledge about baseball.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M2/M2_IMG/3.3.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig 3.3: Inferential KR
</p>
<p>
	Of course, this knowledge is useless unless there is also an inference
	procedure that can exploit it (just as the default knowledge in the
	previous example would have been useless without our algorithm for moving
	through the knowledge structure).
</p>
<p>
	The required inference procedure now 1s one that implements the standard
	logical rules of inference. There are many such procedures, some of which
	reason forward trom given facts to conclusions, others of which reason
	backward from desired conclusions to given facts.
</p>
<p>
	One of the most commonly used of these procedures is resolution, which
	exploits a proof by contradiction strategy.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>IV. </strong>
	<strong>Procedural Knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>
	a. Procedural knowledge approach uses small programs and codes which
	describes how to do specific things, and how to proceed.
</p>
<p>
	b. In this approach, one important rule is used which is If-Then rule.
</p>
<p>
	c. In this knowledge, we can use various coding languages such as LISP
	language and Prolog language.
</p>
<p>
	d. We can easily represent heuristic or domain-specific knowledge using
	this approach.
</p>
<p>
	e. But it is not necessary that we can represent all cases in this
	approach.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	ISSUES IN KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
</p>
<p>
	I. Are any attributes of objects so basic that they occur in almost every
	problem domain? If there are, we need to make sure that they are handled
	appropriately in each of the mechanisms we propose. If such attributes
	exist, what are they?
</p>
<p>
	II. Are there any important relationships that exist among attributes of
	objects?
</p>
<p>
	III. At what level should knowledge be represented? Is there a good set of
	primitives into which all knowledge can be broken down? Is it helpful to
	use such primitives?
</p>
<p>
	IV. How should sets of objects be represented?
</p>
<p>
	V. Given large amount of knowledge stored in a database, how can relevant
	parts be accessed when they are needed?
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Brief Explanation for UNDERSTANDING</strong>
	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	I. <strong>Attributes</strong>
</p>
<p>
	a. Are they basic?
</p>
<p>
	b. Are they occuring frequently?
</p>
<p>
	c. How are they properly represented?
</p>
<p>
	d. E.g., ISA, INSTANCE
</p>
<p>
	II. <strong>Relationship among attributes</strong>
</p>
<p>
	a. Inverse
</p>
<p>
	b. Existence in a ISA hierarchy
</p>
<p>
	c. Techniques for reasoning about value
</p>
<p>
	d. Single valued attributes
</p>
<p>
	III. <strong>Level of KR</strong>
</p>
<p>
	a. Use of primitives to represent knowledge
</p>
<p>
	b. Can knowledge be broken down into a defined set of primitives
</p>
<p>
	c. How such primitives help in KR
</p>
<p>
