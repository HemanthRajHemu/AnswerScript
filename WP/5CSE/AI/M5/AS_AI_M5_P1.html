			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	The Steps involved in Natural Language understanding process are as
	follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Morphological Analysis:</h2></strong>
	Individual words are analysed into their components, and non-word tokens,
	such as punctuation, are separated from the words.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Syntactic Analysis:</h2></strong>
	Linear sequences of words are transformed into structures that show how the
	words relate to each other. Some word sequences may be rejected if they
	violate the language's rules for how words may be combined. For example, an
	English syntactic analyser would reject the sentence "Boy the go the to
	store."
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Semantic Analysis:</h2></strong>
	The structures created by the syntactic analyser are assigned meanings. In
	other words, a mapping is made between the syntactic structures and objects
	in the task domain. Structures for which no such mapping is possible may be
	rejected. For example, in most universes, the sentence "Colorless green
	ideas sleep furiously" [Chomsky, 1957] would be rejected as semantically
	anomolous.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Discourse Integration:</h2></strong>
	The meaning of an individual sentence may depend on the sentences that
	precede it and may influence the meanings of the sentences that follow it.
	For example, the word "it" in the sentence, "John wanted it," depends on
	the prior discourse context, while the word "John" may influence the
	meaning of later sentences (such as, "He always had.")
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Pragmatic Analysis:</h2></strong>
	The structure representing what was said is reinterpreted to determine what
	was actually meant. For example, the sentence "Do you know what time it
	is?" should be interpreted as a request to be told the time.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript2')">Question 2<h1>Write a note on knowledge acquisition. (4-Marks) (9b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">
			
			<p>
	Knowledge acquisition itself includes many different activities. Simple
	storing of computed information, or rote learning, is the most basic
	learning activity. Many computer programs, e.g., database systems, can be
	said to "learn" in this sense, although most people would not call such
	simple storage learning. However, many AT programs are able to improve
	their performance substantially through rote-learning techniques.
</p>
<p>
	Knowledge acquisition is the process to extract structure and organize the
	knowledge from various sources of human experts and is also consider as the
	process of adding new knowledge and to change which was anonymously
	acquired to the knowledge base. It is mainly used in the system
	development. The purpose of knowledge acquisition is to elaborate the
	capability of the system to improve the specific task of the performance
	consisting of facts, rules, concepts, procedures, heuristics, formulas,
	relationships or other useful information.
</p>
<p>
	Knowledge acquisition process facilitates the assimilation of knowledge and
	experiences of different specialties. For example, an agricultural
	diagnostic expert system requires the integration of specialists in various
	fields such as nutrition, plant pathology, entomology, breading, and
	production. When problem occurs, the system can help the user more
	efficiently in identifying the cause of the problem. It then helps in
	consulting a document that handles a specific problem
</p>
<p>
	The existing knowledge and newly acquired knowledge should be incorporated
	in a significant way to draw inferences from resultant body of knowledge
	which will be effective and many of the important conclusions for which the
	systems can be intended. The knowledge should be accurate, non-redundant,
	consistent, non-contradictory and fairly complete in the sense that it will
	be possible to rely reasonably
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Knowledge Acquisition Technique</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	At the heart of the process is the interview. The heuristic model of the
	domain is usually extracted through a series of intense, systematic
	interviews, usually extending over a period of many months. Note that this
	assumes the expert and the knowledge engineer are not the same person. It
	is generally best that the expert and the knowledge engineer not be the
	same person since the deeper the experts' knowledge, the less able they are
	in describing their logic. Furthermore, in their efforts to describe their
	procedures, experts tend to rationalize their knowledge and this can be
	misleading.
</p>
<p>
	General suggestions about the knowledge acquisition process are summarized
	in rough chronological order below:
</p>
<p>
	1. Observe the person solving real problems.
</p>
<p>
	2. Through discussions, identify the kinds of data, knowledge and
	procedures required to solve different types of problems.
</p>
<p>
	3. Build scenarios with the expert that can be associated with different
	problem types.
</p>
<p>
	4. Have the expert solve a series of problems verbally and ask the
	rationale behind each step.
</p>
<p>
	5. Develop rules based on the interviews and solve the problems with them.
</p>
<p>
	6. Have the expert review the rules and the general problem solving
	procedure.
</p>
<p>
	7. Compare the responses of outside experts to a set of scenarios obtained
	from the project's expert and the ES.
</p>
<p>
	Note that most of these procedures require a close working relationship
	between the knowledge engineer and the expert.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>Explain how decision trees are used in learning? (4-Marks) (9c)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	A third approach to concept learning is the induction of decision trees, as
	exemplified by the ID3 program of Quinlan [1986]. [D3 uses a tree
	representation for concepts, such as the one shown in Fig. 3.1. To classify
	a particular input, we start at the top of the tree and answer questions
	until we reach a leaf, where the classification is stored,
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M5/M5_IMG/3.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig: 3.1 A Decision Tree
</p>
<p>
	1D3 uses an iterative method to build up decision trees, preferring simple
	trees over complex ones, on the theory that simple trees are more accurate
	classifiers of future inputs. It begins by choosing a random subset of the
	training examples. This subset is called the window. The algorithm builds a
	decision tree that correctly classifies all examples in the window. The
	tree is then tested on the training examples outside the window. If all the
	examples are classified correctly, the algorithm halts. Otherwise, it adds
	a number of training examples to the window and the process repeats.
	Empirical evidence indicates that the iterative strategy is more efficient
	than considering the whole training set at once.
</p>
<p>
	So how does ID3 actually construct decision trees? Building a node means
	choosing some attribute to test. Ata given point in the tree, some
	attributes will yield more information than others, for example, testing
	the attribute color is useless if the color of a car does not help us to
	classify it correctly. Ideally, an attribute will separate training
	instances into subsets whose members share a common label (e.g., positive
	or negative). In that case, branching is terminated, and the leaf nodes are
	labelled.
</p>
<p>
	There are many variations on this basic algorithm. For example, when we add
	a test that has more than two branches, It is possible that one branch has
	no corresponding training instances. In that case, we can either leave the
	node unlabelled, or we can attempt to guess a label based on statistical
	properties of the set of instances being tested at that point in the tree.
	Noisy input is another issue. One way of handling noisy input is to avoid
	building new branches if the information gained is very slight. In other
	words, we do not want to over complicate the tree to account for isolated
	noisy instances, Another, source of uncertainty is that attribute values
	may be unknown.
</p>
<p>
	For example a patient's medical record may be incomplete. One solution is
	to guess the correct branch to take; another solution is to build special
	"unknown" branches at each node during learning.

			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
    Semantic grammars, which combine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic
    knowledge into a single set of rules in the form of a grammar. The result
    of parsing with such a grammar is a semantic, rather than just a syntactic,
    description of a sentence.
</p>
<p>
    Case grammars, in which the structure that is built by the parser contains
    some semantic information, although further interpretation may also be
    necessary.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 5<h1>Explain the process of the learning from examples. (6-Marks) (10b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	Classification is the process of assigning to a particular input, the name
	of a class to which it belongs. The classes from which the classification
	procedure can choose can be described in a variety of ways. Their
	definition will depend on the use to which they will be put.
</p>
<p>
	Classification is an important component of many problem-solving tasks. In
	its simplest form, it is presented as a straightforward recognition task.
	An example of this is the question "What letter of the alphabet is this?"
	But often classification is embedded inside another operation. To see how
	this can happen, consider a problem solving system that contains the
	following production rule:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>
		If: the current goal is to get from place A to place B, and there is a
		WALL separating the two places
	</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>then: look for a DOORWAY in the WALL and go through it.</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	To use this rule successfully, the system's matching routine must be able
	to identify an object as a wall. Without this, the rule can never be
	invoked. Then, to apply the rule, the system must be able to recognize a
	doorway.
</p>
<p>
	Before classification can be done, the classes it will use must be defined.
	This can be done in a variety of ways, including:
</p>
<p>
	&#216; Isolate a set of features that are relevant to the task domain.
	Define each class by a weighted sum of values of these features. Each class
	is then defined by a scoring function that looks very similar to the
	scoring functions often used in other situations, such as game playing.
	Such a function has the form:
</p>
<p align="center">
c<sub>1</sub>l<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>l<sub>2</sub> + c<sub>3</sub>l	<sub>3</sub> + &#8230;.
</p>
<p>
	Each t corresponds to a value of a relevant parameter, and each c
	represents the weight to be attached to the corresponding 4 Negative
	weights can be used to indicate features whose presence usually constitutes
	negative evidence for a given class.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if the task is weather prediction, the parameters can be such
	measurements as rainfall and location of cold fronts. Different functions
	can be written to combine these parameters to predict sunny, cloudy, rainy,
	or snowy weather.
</p>
<p>
	&#216; Isolate a set of features that are relevant to the task domain.
	Define each class as a structure composed of those features. For example,
	if the task is to identify animals, the body of each type of animal can be
	stored as a structure, with various features representing such things as
	color, length of neck, and feathers.
</p>
<p>
	There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these general approaches.
	The statistical approach taken by the first scheme presented here is often
	more efficient than the structural approach taken by the second. But the
	second is more flexible and more extensible.
</p>
<p>
	Regardless of the way that classes are to be described, it is often
	difficult to construct, by hand, good class definitions. This is
	particularly true in domains that are not well understood or that change
	rapidly. Thus the idea of producing a classification program that can
	evolve its own class definitions is appealing. This task of constructing
	class definitions is called concept learning, or induction. The techniques
	used for this task must, of course, depend on the way that classes
	(concepts) are described. If classes are described by scoring functions,
	then concept learning can be done using the technique of coefficient
	adjustment, however, we want to define classes structurally, some other
	technique for learning class definitions is necessary. In this section, we
	present three such techniques.
