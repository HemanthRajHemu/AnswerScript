			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	<strong><h2>Definition of a Script:</h2></strong>
	A script is a structure that describes a stereotyped sequence of events in
	a particular context. A script consists of a set of slots. Associated with
	each slot may be some information about what kinds of values it may contain
	as well as a default value to be used if no other information is available.
</p>
<p>
	The components of a Script are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	i. <strong><h2>Entry conditions</h2></strong>: Conditions that must, in general, be
	satisfied before the events described in the script can occur.
</p>
<p>
	ii. <strong><h2>Result:</h2></strong> Conditions that will, in general, be true
	after the events described in the script have occurred.
</p>
<p>
	iii. <strong><h2>Props:</h2></strong> Slots representing objects that are involved
	in the events described in the script. The presence of these objects can be
	inferred even if they are not mentioned explicitly.
</p>
<p>
	iv. <strong><h2>Roles:</h2></strong> Slots representing people who are involved in
	the events described in the script. The presence of these people, too, can
	be inferred even if they are not mentioned explicitly. If specific
	individuals are mentioned, they can be inserted into the appropriate slots.
</p>
<p>
	v. <strong><h2>Track:</h2></strong> The specific variation on a more general pattern
	that is represented by this particular script. Different tracks of the same
	script will share many but not all components.
</p>
<p>
	vi. <strong><h2>Scenes:</h2></strong> The actual sequences of events that occur. The
	events are represented in conceptual dependency formalism.

			2.	Explain the MINIMAX algorithm. Consider the following game tree in which static tree are all from the first players point of view. Apply MINIMAX algorithm to decide which move to be chosen (suppose the first player is the maximizing player). (12-Marks) (7b)
			</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript2">

alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
			<p>
	The minimax search procedure is a depth-first, depth-limited search
	procedure. The idea is to start at the current position and use the
	plausible-move generator to generate the set of possible successor
	positions. Now we can apply the static evaluation 'unction to those
	positions and simply choose the best one. After doing so, we can back that
	value up to the starting position to represent our evaluation of it. The
	starting position is exactly as good for us as the position generated by
	the best move we can make next. Here we assume that the static evaluation
	function returns large values to indicate good situations for us, so our
	goal is to maximize the value of the static evaluation function of the next
	board position.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Algorithm: MINIMAX(Position, Depth, Player)</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	2.1. If DEEP-ENOUGH(Position, Depth), then return the structure
</p>
<p>
	VALUE=STATIC(Position, Player),
</p>
<p>
	PATH = nil
</p>
<p>
	This indicates that there is no path from this node and that its value is
	that determined by the static evaluation function.
</p>
<p>
	2.2. Otherwise, generate one more ply of the tree by calling the function
	MOVE-GEN(Position Player) and setting SUCCESSORS to the list it returns.
</p>
<p>
	2.3. If SUCCESSORS is empty, then there are no moves to be made, so return
	the same structure that would have been returned if DEEP-ENOUGH had
	returned true.
</p>
<p>
	2.4. 1f SUCCESSORS is not empty, then examine each element in turn and keep
	track of the best one. This is done as follows.
</p>
<p>
	Initialize BEST-SCORE to the minimum value that STATIC can return. It will
	be updated to reflect the best score that can be achieved by an element of
	SUCCESSORS.
</p>
<p>
	For each element SUCC of SUCCESSORS, do the following:
</p>
<p>
	(a) Set RESULT-SUCC to
</p>
<p>
	MINIMAX(SUCC, Depth + 1, OPPOSITE(Player))
</p>
<p>
	This recursive call to MINIMAX will actually carry out the exploration of
	SUCC.
</p>
<p>
	(b) Set NEW-VALUE to - VALUE(RESULT-SUCC). This will cause it to reflect
	the merits of the position from the opposite perspective from that of the
	next lower level.
</p>
<p>
	(c) If NEW-VALUE &gt; BEST-SCORE, then we have found a successor that is
	better than any that have been examined so far. Record this by doing the
	following:
</p>
<p>
	(i) Set BEST-SCORE to NEW-VALUE.
</p>
<p>
	(ii) The best known path is now from CURRENT to SUCC and then on to the
	appropriate path down from SUCC as determined by the recursive call to
	MINIMAX. So set BEST-PATH to the result of attaching SUCCto the front of
	PATH(RESULT-SUCC).
</p>
<p>
	2.5. Now that all the successors have been examined, we know the value of
	Position as well as which path to take from it. So return the structure
</p>
<p>
	VALUE = BEST-SCORE
</p>
<p>
	PATH = BEST-PATH
</p>
<p>
	When the initial call to MINIMAX returns, the best move from CURRENT is the
	first element on PATH.
</p>
<p>
	The MINIMAX procedure just described is very simple. But its performance
	can be improved significantly with a few refinements.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript3')">Question 3<h1>List the rules of conceptual dependency. (6-Marks) (8a)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript3">
			
			<p>
	The Rules of Conceptual Dependency (CD) are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 1</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between an actor and the event he or she causes.
	This is a two-way dependency since neither actor nor event can be
	considered primary. The letter p above the dependency link indicates past
	tense.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 2</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between a PP and a PA that is being asserted to
	describe it. Many state descriptions, such as height, are represented in CD
	as numeric scales.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 3</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between two PPs, one of which belongs to the set
	defined by the other.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 4</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between a PP and an attribute that has already
	been predicated of it. The direction of the arrow is toward the PP being
	described.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 5</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between two PPs, one of which provides a
	particular kind of information about the other. The three most common types
	of information to be provided in this way are possession (shown as
	POSS-BY), location (shown as LOC), and physical containment (shown as
	CONT). The direction of the arrow is again toward the concept being
	described.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 6</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between an ACT and the PP that is the object of
	that ACT. The direction of the arrow is toward the ACT since the context of
	the specific ACT determines the meaning of the object relation.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 7</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between an ACT and the source and, the recipient
	of the ACT.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 8</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between an ACT and the instrument with which it
	is performed. The instrument must always be a full conceptualization (i.e.
	it must contain an ACT), not just a single physical object.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 9</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between an ACT and its physical source and
	destination.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 10</h2></strong>
	represents the relationship between a PP and a state in which it started
	and another in which it ended.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 11</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between one conceptualization and another that
	causes it. Notice that the arrows indicate dependency of one
	conceptualization on another and so point in the opposite direction of the
	implication arrows. The two forms of the mule describe the cause of an
	action and the cause of a state change.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 12</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between a conceptualization and the time at
	which the event it describes occurred.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 13</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between one conceptualization and another that
	is the time of the first. The example for this rule also shows how CD
	exploits a model of the human information processing system; see is
	represented as the transfer of information between the eyes and the
	conscious processor.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Rule 14</h2></strong>
	describes the relationship between a conceptualization and the place at
	which it occurred.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 4<h1>Why should we want to build large knowledge bases? (4-Marks) (8b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	There are many reasons, among them:
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Brittleness:</h2></strong>
	Specialized knowledge-based systems are brittle. They cannot cope with
	novel situations, and their performance degradation is not graceful.
	Programs built on top of deep, common sense knowledge about the world
	should rest on firmer foundations.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Form and Content:</h2></strong>
	The techniques we have seen so far for representing and using knowledge may
	or may not be sufficient for the purposes of AI. One good way to find out
	is to start coding large amounts of common sense knowledge and see where
	the difficulties crop up. In other words, one strategy is to focus
	temporarily on the content of knowledge bases rather than on their form.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Shared Knowledge:</h2></strong>
	Small knowledge-based systems must make simplifying assumptions about how
	to represent things like space, time, motion, and structure. If these
	things can be represented once at a very high level, then domain-specific
	systems can gain leverage cheaply. Also, systems that share the same
	primitives can communicate easily with one another.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 5<h1>Write a note on iterative deepening. (6-Marks) (8c)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			<p>
	A number of ideas for searching two-player game trees have led to new
	algorithms for single-agent heuristic search. One such idea is iterative
	deepening, originally used in a program called CHESS 4.5. Rather than
	searching to a fixed depth in the game tree, CHESS 4,5 first searched only
	a single ply, applying its static evaluation function to the result of each
	of its possible moves. It then initiated a new minimax search, this time to
	a depth of two ply.
</p>
<p>
	This was followed by a three-ply search, then a four-ply search, etc. The
	name "iterative deepening" derives from the fact that on each iteration,
	the tree is searched one level deeper. The Below figure depicts this
	process.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M4/M4_IMG/5.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig 5.1 : Iterative Deepening
</p>
<p>
	On the face of it, this process seems wasteful. Why should we be interested
	in any iteration except the final one? There are several reasons. First,
	game-playing programs are subject to time constraints. For example, a chess
	program may be required to complete all its moves within two hours. Since
	it is impossible to know in advance how long a fixed-depth tree search will
	take (because of variations in pruning efficiency and the need for
	selective search), a program may find itself running out of time. With
	iterative deepening, the current search can be aborted at any time and the
	best move found by the previous iteration can be played. Perhaps more
	importantly, previous iterations can provide invaluable move-ordering
	constraints. If one move was judged to be superior to its siblings in a
	previous iteration, it can be searched first in the next iteration. With
	effective ordering, the alpha-beta procedure can prune many more branches,
	and total search time can be decreased drastically. This allows more time
	for deeper iterations.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Algorithm: Depth-First Iterative Deepening</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Step 1. Set SEARCH-DEPTH = 1.
</p>
<p>
	Step 2. Conduct a depth-first search to a depth of SEARCH-DEPTH. If a
	solution path is found, then return it.
</p>
<p>
	Step 3. Otherwise, increment SEARCH-DEPTH by I and go to step 2.
</p>
<p>
	Clearly, DFID will find the shortest solution path to the goal state.
	Moreover, the maximum amount of memory used by DFID is proportional to the
	number of nodes in that solution path. The only disturbing fact is that all
	iterations but the final one are essentially wasted. However, this is not a
	serious problem. The reason is that most of the activity during any given
	iteration occurs at the leaf-node level. Assuming a complete tree, we see
	that there are as many leaf nodes at level n as there are total nodes in
	levels I through n. Thus, the work expended during the nth iteration is
	roughly equal to the work expended during all previous iterations, This
	means that DFID is only slower than depth-first search by a constant
	factor. The problem with depth-first Search is that there is no way to know
	in advance how deep the solution lies in the search space. DFID avoids the
	problem of choosing cut offs without sacrificing efficiency, and, in fact,
	DFID is the optimal algorithm (in terms of space and time) for uninformed
	search.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>Algorithm: Iterative-Deepening-A*</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	1. Set THRESHOLD=the heuristic evaluation of the start state.
</p>
<p>
	2. Conduct a depth-first search, pruning any branch when its total cost
	function (g + A') exceeds THRESHOLD. If a solution path is found during the
	search, return it.
</p>
<p>
	3. Otherwise, increment THRESHOLD by the minimum amount it was exceeded
	during the previous step, and then go to Step 2.
</p>
<p>
	Like A*, Iterative-Deepening-A* (IDA*) is guaranteed to find an optimal
	solution, provided that h' is an admissible heuristic. Because of its
	depth-first search technique, [DA* is very efficient with respect to space.
	IDA* was the first heuristic search algorithm to find optimal solution
	paths for the 15-puzzle (a 4x4 version of the 8-puzzle) within reasonable
	time and space constraints.
