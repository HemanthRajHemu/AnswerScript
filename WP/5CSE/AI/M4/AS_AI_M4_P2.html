			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	Conceptual dependency (often nicknamed CD)is a theory of how to represent
	the kind of knowledge about events that is usually contained in natural
	language sentences. The goal is to represent the knowledge in a way that
</p>
<p>
	i. Facilitates drawing inferences from the sentences.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Is independent of the language in which the sentences were originally
	stated.
</p>
<p>
	Because of the two concerns just mentioned, the CD representation of a
	sentence is built not out of primitives corresponding to the words used in
	the sentence, but rather out of conceptual primitives that can be combined
	to form the meanings of words in any particular language.
</p>
<p>
	conceptual dependency provides both a structure and a specific set of
	primitives, at a particular level of granularity, out of which
	representations of particular pieces of information can be constructed.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 9<h1>Write a note on global ontology. (10-Marks) (8b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<p>
	<strong>Ontology</strong>
	is the philosophical study of what exists. In the AI context, ontology is
	concerned with which categories we can usefully quantify over and how those
	categories relate to each other. All knowledge-based systems refer to
	entities in the world, but in order to capture the breadth of human
	knowledge, we need a well-designed global ontology that specifies at a very
	high level what kinds of things exist and what their general properties
	are. As mentioned above, such a global ontology should provide a more solid
	foundation for domain-specific Al programs and should also allow them to
	communicate with each other.
</p>
<p>
	The highest level concept in CYC is called Thing. Everything is an instance
	of Thing. Below this top-level concept, CYC makes several distinctions,
	including:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Individual Object versus Collection:</strong>
	Here are some examples of frames that are instances of Collection: Person,
	Nation, Nose. Some instances of Individual Object are Fred, Greece, Fred's
	Nose. These two sets share no common instances, and any instance of Thing
	must be an instance of one of the two sets. Anything that is an instance of
	Collection is a subset of Thing. Only Collections may have supersets and
	subsets; only Individual Objects may have parts.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Intangible, Tangible, and Composite</strong>
	: Instances of Intangible are things without mass, e.g., sets, numbers,
	laws, and events. Instances of Tangible Object are things with mass that
	have no intangible aspect, e.g., a person's body, an orange, and dirt.
	Every instance of TangibleObject is also an instance
</p>
<p>
	of IndividualObject since sets have no mass. Instances of CompositeObject
	have two key slots, physicalExtent and intangibleExtent. For example, a
	person is a CompositeObject whose physicalExtent is his body and whose
	&#233;ntangibleExtent is his mind.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Substance:</strong>
	Substance is a subclass of IndividualObyect. Any subclass of Substance is
	something that retains its properties when it is cut up into smaller
	pieces. For example, Wood is a Substance. A concept like Table34 can be an
	instance of both Wood (a Substance) and Table (an IndividualObject).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Intrinsic versus Extrinsic properties:</strong>
	A property is intrinsic if when an object has that property all parts of
	the object also have that property. For example, <em>color</em> is an
	intrinsic property. Objects tend to inherit their intrinsic properties from
	Substances. Extrinsic properties include things like number-of-legs.
	Objects tend to inherit their extrinsic properties from IndividualObjects.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Event and Process:</strong>
	An Event is anything with temporal extent, e.g., Walking. Process is a
	subclass of Event. If every temporal slice of an Event is essentially the
	same as the entire Event, then that Event is also a Process. For example,
	Walking is a Process, but WalkingTwoMiles is not. This relationship is
	analogous to Substance and IndividualObject.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Slots:</strong>
	Slot is a subclass of Intangible. There are many types of Slot.
	BookkeepingSiots record such information as when a frame was created and by
	whom. DefiningSlots refer not to properties of the frame but to properties
	of the object represented by the frame. Defining Slots are further divided
	into intensional, taxonomic, and extensional categories. QuantitativeSlots
	are those which take on a scalar range of values, e.g., height, as opposed
	to gender.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Time:</strong>
	Events can have temporal properties, such as duration and startsBefore. CYC
	deals with two basic types of temporal measures: intervals, and sets of
	intervals, A number of basic interval properties, such as endsDuring, are
	denned from the property before, which applies to starting and ending times
	for events. Sets of intervals are built up from basic intervals through
	operations like union and intersection. Thus, it is possible to state facts
	like "John goes to the movies at three o'clock every Sunday."
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Agent:</strong>
	An important subset of CompositeObject is Agent, the collection of
	intelligent beings. Agents can be collective (e.g., corporations) own
	dividual (e.g., people). Agents have a number of properties, one of which
	is beliefs. Agents often ascribe their own beliefs to other agents in order
	to facilitate communication. An agent's beliefs may be incorrect, so CYC
	must be able to distinguish between facts in. its own knowledge base (CYC's
	beliefs) and "facts" that are possibly inconsistent with the knowledge
	base.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript5')">Question 10<h1>List out the properties of full-fledged objects. (mod 3)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript5">
			
			<p>
	The properties of full-fledged objects are as follows:
</p>
<p>
	i. The classes to which the attribute can be attached, i.e. for what
	classes does it make sense? For example, weight makes sense for physical
	objects but not for conceptual ones (except in some metaphorical sense).
</p>
<p>
	ii. Constraints on either the type or the value of the attribute. For
	example, the age of a person must be a numeric quantity measured in some
	time frame, and it must be less than the ages of the person's biological
	parents.
</p>
<p>
	iii. A value that all instances of a class must have by the definition of
	the class.
</p>
<p>
	iv. A default value for the attribute.
</p>
<p>
	v. Rules for inheriting values for the attribute. The usual rule is to
	inherit down isa and instance links.But someattributes inherit in other
	ways. For example, /ast-name inherits down the child-of link.
</p>
<p>
	vi. Rules for computing a value separately from inheritance. One extreme
	form of such arule is a procedure written in some procedural programming
	language such as LISP.
</p>
<p>
	vii. An inverse attribute.
</p>
<p>
	viii. Whether the slot is single-valued or multivalued.
