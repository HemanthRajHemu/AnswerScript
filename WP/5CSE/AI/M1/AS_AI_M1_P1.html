			<div class="ansCover">
			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript1')">Question 1<h1>Explain different characteristics of the AI problem used for analysing it to choose most appropriate method. (8-Marks) (1a)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	Heuristic search is a very general method applicable to a large class of
	problems. It encompasses a variety of specific techniques, each of which is
	particularly effective for a small class of problems. In order to choose
	the most appropriate method (or combination of methods) for a particular
	problem, it is necessary to analyse the problem along several key
	dimensions:
</p>
<p>
	I. Is the problem decomposable into a set of (nearly) independent smaller
	or easier sub problems?
</p>
<p>
	II. Can solution steps be ignored or at least undone if they prove unwise?
</p>
<p>
	III. Is the problem's universe predictable?
</p>
<p>
	IV. Is a good solution to the problem obvious without comparison to all
	other possible solutions?
</p>
<p>
	V. Is the desired solution a state of the world or a path to a state?
</p>
<p>
	VI. Is a large amount of knowledge absolutely required to solve the
	problem, or is knowledge important only to constrain the search?
</p>
<p>
	VII. Can a computer that is simply given the problem return the solution,
	or will the solution of the problem require interaction between the
	computer and a person?
</p>
<p>
	Notice that some of these questions involve not just the statement of the
	problem itself but also characteristics of the solution that is desired and
	the circumstances under which the solution must take place.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.1 Is the Problem Decomposable?</h2></strong>
	<strong><h2></h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Suppose we want to solve the problem of computing the expression.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M1/M1_IMG/1.1.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	We can solve this problem by breaking it down into three smaller problems,
	each of which we can then solve by using a small collection of specific
	rules.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M1/M1_IMG/1.2.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig: A Decomposable Problem
</p>
<p>
	The above Figure shows the problem tree that will be generated by the
	process of problem decomposition as it can be exploited by a simple
	recursive integration program that works as follows: At each step, it
	checks to see whether the problem it is working on is immediately solvable.
	H so, then the answer is returned directly. If the problem is not easily
	solvable, the integrator checks to see whether it can decompose the problem
	into smaller problems. If it can, it creates those problems and calls
	itself recursively on them. Using this technique of problem decomposition,
	we can often solve very large problems easily.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><h2>1.2 Can Solution Steps Be Ignored or Undone?</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Suppose we are trying to prove a mathematical theorem. We proceed by first
	proving a lemma that we think will be useful. A lemma that has been proved
	can be ignored for next steps as eventually we realize the lemma is no help
	at all.
</p>
<p>
	Now consider the 8-puzzle game. A sample game using the 8-puzzle is shown
	below:
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M1/M1_IMG/1.3.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p align="center">
	Fig: An Example of the 8-Puzzle
</p>
<p>
	<em>
		In attempting to solve the 8 puzzle, we might make a stupid move for
		example; we slide the tile 5 into an empty space. We actually want to
		slide the tile 6 into empty space but we can back track and undo the
		first move, sliding tile 5 back to where it was then we can know tile 6
		so mistake and still recovered from but not quit as easy as in the
		theorem moving problem. An additional step must be performed to undo
		each incorrect step.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>
		Now consider the problem of playing chess. Suppose a chess playing
		problem makes a stupid move and realize a couple of moves later. But
		here solutions steps cannot be undone.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	The above three problems illustrate difference between three important
	classes of problems:
</p>
<p>
	1) Ignorable: in which solution steps can be ignored. Example: Theorem
	Proving
</p>
<p>
	2) Recoverable: in which solution steps can be undone. Example: 8-Puzzle
</p>
<p>
	3) Irrecoverable: in which solution steps cannot be undone. Example: Chess
</p>
<p>
	The recoverability of a problem plays an important role in determining the
	complexity of the control structure necessary for problem solution.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Ignorable problems </em>
can be solved using a simple control structure that never backtracks.	<em>Recoverable problems </em>can be solved by slightly complicated control
strategy that does sometimes make mistakes using backtracking.	<em>Irrecoverable problems </em>can be solved by recoverable style methods
	via planning that expands a great deal of effort making each decision since
	the decision is final.
</p>
<p>
	1.3 Is the universe predictable?
</p>
<p>
	There are certain outcomes every time we make a move we will know what
	exactly happen. This means it is possible to plan entire sequence of moves
	and be confident that we know what the resulting state will be. Example is
	8-Puzzle.
</p>
<p>
	In the uncertain problems, this planning process may not be possible.
	Example: Bridge Game - Playing Bridge. We cannot know exactly where all the
	cards are or what the other players will do on their turns.
</p>
<p>
	We can do fairly well since we have available accurate estimates of a
	probabilities of each of the possible outcomes. A few examples of such
	problems are
</p>
<p>
	I. Controlling a robot arm: The outcome is uncertain for a variety of
	reasons. Someone might move something into the path of the arm. The gears
	of the arm might stick.
</p>
<p>
	II. Helping a lawyer decide how to defend his client against a murder
	charge. Here we probably cannot even list all the possible outcomes, which
	leads outcome to be uncertain.
</p>
<p>
	1.4 Is a Good Solution Absolute or Relative?
</p>
<p>
	Consider the problem of answering questions based on a database of simple
	facts, such as the following:
</p>
<p>
	1) Marcus was a man.
</p>
<p>
	2) Marcus was a Pompeian.
</p>
<p>
	3) Marcus was born in 40 A.D.
</p>
<p>
	4) All men are mortal.
</p>
<p>
	5) All Pompeian's died when the volcano erupted in 79 A.D.
</p>
<p>
	6) No mortal lives longer than 150 years. 7) It is now 1991 A.D.
</p>
<p>
	Suppose we ask a question "Is Marcus alive?" By representing each of these
	facts in a formal language such as predicate logic, and then using formal
	inference methods we can fairly easily derive an answer to the question.
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M1/M1_IMG/1.4.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	Since we are interested in the answer to the question, it does not matter
	which path we follow. If we do follow one path successfully to the answer,
	there is no reason to go back and see if some other path might also lead to
	a solution. These types of problems are called as "Any path Problems".
</p>
<p>
	Now consider the Travelling Salesman Problem. Our goal is to find the
	shortest path route that visits each city exactly once
</p>
			<center><img src="https://hemanthrajhemu.github.io/AnswerScript/WP/5CSE/AI/M1/M1_IMG/1.5.png" 
alt="Loading Image" class="resIMG"/></center><br/>
<p>
	Suppose we find a path it may not be a solution to the problem. We also try
	all other paths. The shortest path (best path) is called as a solution to
	the problem. These types of problems are known as "Best path" problems. But
	path problems are computationally harder than any path problems.
</p>
<p>
	1.5 Is the solution a state or a path?
</p>
<p>
	Consider the problem of finding a consistent interpretation for the
	sentence
</p>
<p>
	<em>The bank president ate a dish of pasta salad with the fork</em>
</p>
<p>
	There are several components of this sentence, each of which may have more
	than one interpretation. Some of the sources of ambiguity in this sentence
	are the following:
</p>
<p>
	I. The word "Bank" may refer either to a financed institution or to a side
	of river. But only one of these may have a President.
</p>
<p>
	II. The word "dish" is the object of the word "eat". It is possible that a
	dish was eaten.
</p>
<p>
	III. But it is more likely that the pasta salad in the dish was eaten.
</p>
<p>
	Because of the interaction among the interpretations of the constituents of
	the sentence some search may be required to find a complete interpreter for
	the sentence. But to solve the problem of finding the interpretation we
	need to produce only the interpretation itself. No record of the processing
	by which the interpretation was found is necessary. But with the
	"water-jug" problem it is not sufficient to report the final state we have
	to show the "path" also.
</p>
<p>
	So the solution of natural language understanding problem is a state of the
	world. And the solution of "Water jug" problem is a path to a state.
</p>
<p>
	1.6 What is the role of knowledge?
</p>
<p>
	Consider the problem of playing chess. The knowledge required for this
	problem is the rules for determining legal move and some simple control
	mechanism that implements an appropriate search procedure.
</p>
<p>
	Now consider the problem of scanning daily newspapers to decide which are
	supporting 'n' party and which are supporting 'y' party. For this problems
	are required lot of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	The above two problems illustrate the difference between the problems for
	which a lot of knowledge is important only to constrain the search for a
	solution and those for which a lot of knowledge is required even to be able
	to recognize a solution.
</p>
<p>
	1.7 Does a task require interaction with the person?
</p>
<p>
	Suppose that we are trying to prove some new very difficult theorem. We
	might demand a prove that follows traditional patterns so that
	mathematician each read the prove and check to make sure it is correct.
	Alternatively, finding a proof of the theorem might be sufficiently
	difficult that the program does not know where to start. At the moment
	people are still better at doing the highest level strategies required for
	a proof. So that the computer might like to be able to ask for advice.
</p>
<p>
	For Example:
</p>
<p>
	I. Solitary problem, in which there is no intermediate communication and no
	demand for an explanation of the reasoning process.
</p>
<p>
	II. Conversational problem, in which intermediate communication is to
	provide either additional assistance to the computer or additional
	information to the user.

	<strong><h2>Problem Reduction:</h2></strong>
</p>
<p>
	I. Planning how best to solve a problem that can be recursively decomposed
	into subproblems in multiple ways.
</p>
<p>
	II. There can be more than one decompositions of the same problem. We have
	to decide which is the best way to decompose the problem so that the total
	solution or cost of the solution is good.
</p>
<p>
	III. Examples:
</p>
<p>
	a. Matrix Multiplication
</p>
<p>
	b. Towers of Hanoi
</p>
<p>
	c. Blocks World Problem
</p>
<p>
	d. Theorem Proving
</p>
<p>
	IV. Formulations: (AND/OR Graphs)
</p>
<p>
	a. An OR node represents a choice between possible decompositions.
</p>
<p>
	b. An AND node represents a given decomposition.
</p>
<p>
	The AND-OR graph (or tree) is useful for representing the solution of
	problems that can be solved by decomposing them into a set of smaller
	problems, all of which must then be solved. This decomposition or reduction
	generate arcs that we call AND arcs.
</p>
<p>
	One AND arc may point to any number of successors nodes all of which must
	be solved in order for the arc to point to a solution. Just as in OR graph,
	several arcs may emerge from a single node, indicating a variety of ways in
	which the original problem might be solved.
</p>
<p>
	In order to find solutions in an AND-OR graph, we need an algorithm similar
	to best-first search but with the ability to handle the AND arcs
	appropriately.

<p>
	To see why our Best-First search is not adequate for searching AND-OR
	graphs, consider Fig (a).
</p>
<p>
	I. The top node A has been expanded, producing 2 arcs, one leading to B and
	one leading to C and D. The numbers at each node represent the value of f'
	at that node.
</p>
<p>
	II. We assume for simplicity that every operation has a uniform cost, so
	each arc with a single successor has a cost of 1 and each AND arc with
	multiple successors has a cost of 1 for each of its components.
</p>
<p>
	III. If we look just at the nodes and choose for expansion the one with the
	lowest f' value, we must select C. It would be better to explore the path
	going through B since to use C we must also use D, for a total cost of 9
	(C+D+2) compared to the cost of 6 that we get through B.
</p>
<p>
	IV. The choice of which node to expand next must depend not only on the f'
	value of that node but also on whether that node is part of the current
	best path from the initial node.
</p>
<p>
	The tree shown in Fig (b)
</p>
<p>
	I. The most promising single node is G with an f' value of 3. It is even
	part of the most promising arc G-H, with a total cost of 9. But that arc is
	not part of the current best path since to use it we must also use the arc
	I-J, with a cost of 27.
</p>
<p>
	II. The path from A, through B, to E and F is better, with a total cost of
	18. So we should not expand G next; rather we should examine either E or F.
</p>
<p>
	In order to describe an algorithm for searching an AND-OR graph we need to
	exploit a value that we call FUTILITY. If the estimated cost of a solution
	becomes greater than the value of FUTILITY, then we abandon the search.
	FUTILITY should be chosen to correspond to a threshold such any solution
	with a cost above it is too expensive to be practical even if it could ever
	be found.
</p>
<p>
	Algorithm:
</p>
<p>
	1. Initialize the graph to the starting node.
</p>
<p>
	2. Loop until the starting node is labeled SOLVED or until its cost goes
	above FUTILITY:
</p>
<p>
	a. Traverse the graph, starting at the initial node following the current
	best path and accumulate the set of nodes that are on that path and have
	not yet been expanded or labeled solved.
</p>
<p>
	b. Pick up one of those unexpanded nodes and expand it. If there are no
	successors, assign FUTILITY as the value of this node. Otherwise add the
	successors to the graph and each of this compute f' (use only h' and ignore
	g). If f' of any node is "0", mark the node as SOLVED.
</p>
<p>
	c. Change the f' estimate of the newly expanded node to reflect the new
	information provided by its successors. Propagate this change backward
	through the graph. If any node contains a successor whose descendants are
	all solved, label the node itself as SOLVED. At each node that is visible
	while going up the graph, decide which of its successors arcs is the most
	promising and mark it as part of the current best path. This may cause the
	current best path to change. The propagation of revised cost estimates
	backup the tree was not necessary in the best-first search algorithm
	because only unexpanded nodes were examined. But now expanded nodes must be
	reexamined so that the best current path can be selected. Thus it is
	important that their f' values be the best estimates available.
</p>

<p>
	I. At Step 1, A is the only node, so it is at the end of the current best
	path. It is expanded, yielding nodes B, C and D. The arc to D is labeled as
	the most promising one emerging from A, since it costs 6 compared to B and
	C, which costs 9.
</p>
<p>
	II. In Step 2, node D is chosen for expansion. This process produces one
	new arc, the AND arc to E and F, with a combined cost estimate of 10. So we
	update the f' value of D to 10.
</p>
<p>
	III. We see that the AND arc B-C is better than the arc to D, so it is
	labeled as the current best path. At Step 3, we traverse that arc from A
	and discover the unexpanded nodes B and C. If we are going to find a
	solution along this path, we will have to expand both B and C eventually.
	SO explore B first.
</p>
<p>
	IV. This generates two new arcs, the ones to G and to H. Propagating their
	f' values backward, we update f' to B to 6. This requires updating the cost
	of AND arc B-C to 12 (6+4+2). Now the arc to D is again the better path
	from A, so we record that as the current best path and either node E or F
	will be chosen for the expansion at Step 4.
</p>
<p>
	This process continues until either a solution is found or all paths have
	led to dead ends, indicating that there is no solution.
