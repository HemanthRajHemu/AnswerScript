			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript1">
			
			<p>
	<strong>Steepest Hill Climbing</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A useful variation on simple hill climbing considers all the moves from the
	current state and selects the best one as the next state. This method is
	called <em>steepest-ascent hill climbing </em>or <em>gradient search</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Algorithm:
</p>
<p>
	1. Evaluate the initial state. If it is also a goal state then return it
	and quit. Otherwise continue with the initial state as the current state.
</p>
<p>
	2. Loop until a solution is found or until a complete iteration produces no
	change to current state:
</p>
<p>
	a. Let SUCC be a state such that any possible successor of the current
	state will be better than SUCC.
</p>
<p>
	b. For each operator that applies to the current state do:
</p>
<p>
	i. Apply the operator and generate a new state.
</p>
<p>
	ii. Evaluate the new state. If it is a goal state, then return it and quit.
	If not compare it to SUCC. If it is better, then set SUCC to this state. If
	it is not better, leave SUCC alone.
</p>
<p>
	c. IF the SUCC is better than current state, then set current state to
	SUCC.
</p>
<p>
	Bothe basic and steepest-ascent hill climbing may fail to find a solution.
	Either algorithm may terminate not by finding a goal state but by getting a
	state from which no better states can be generated. This will happen if the
	program has reached a local maximum, a plateau or a ridge.
</p>
<p>
	A <em>local maximum </em>is a state that is better than all its neighbors
	but it not better than some other states farther away. At the local
	maximum, all moves appear to make things worse. Local maxima are
	particularly frustrating because they often occur almost within sight of a
	solution. In this case, they are called <em>foothills</em>.

<p>
	A
</p>
<em>plateau </em>
<p>
	is a flat area of the search space in which a whole set of has the same
	value. In this, it is not possible to determine the best d move by making
	local comparisons.
</p>
<p>
	A <em>ridge </em>is a special kind of maximum. It is an area of the search
	space that is higher than surrounding areas and that itself has a slope.
</p>
<p>
	There are some ways of dealing with these problems, although these methods
	are by no means guaranteed:
</p>
<p>
	I. Backtrack to some earlier node and try going in a different direction.
	This is particularly reasonable if at that node there was another direction
	that looked as promising or almost as promising as the one that was chosen
	earlier. This is a fairly good way to deal with local maxima.
</p>
<p>
	II. Make a big jump in some direction to try to get to a new section of the
	search space. This is a good way of dealing with plateaus.
</p>
<p>
	III. Apply two or more rules before doing the test. This corresponds to
	moving in several directions at once. This is a good strategy for dealing
	with ridges.

			<div class="QAS"><a onclick="show('ANScript4')">Question 9<h1>Explain four categories of production system. (04 Marks) (2b)</h1></a></div>
			<div class="ansclass" id="ANScript4">
			
			<h2>
	<strong>Production System</strong>
</h2>
<p>
	The entire procedure for getting a solution for AI problem can be viewed as
	"Production System". It provides the desired goal. It is a basic building
	block which describes the AI problem and also describes the method of
	searching the goal. Its main components are:
</p>
<p>
	I. A Set of Rules, each consisting of a left side (a pattern) that
	determines the applicability of the rule and right side that describes the
	operation to be performed if the rule is applied.
</p>
<p>
	II. Knowledge Base - It contains whatever information is appropriate for a
	particular task. Some parts of the database may be permanent, while the
	parts of it may pertain only to the solution of the current problem.
</p>
<p>
	III. Control Strategy - It specifies the order in which the rules will be
	compared to the database and the way of resolving the conflicts that arise
	when several rules match at one.
</p>
<p>
	a. The first requirement of a goal control strategy is that it is cause
	motion; a control strategy that does not cause motion will never lead to a
	solution.
</p>
<p>
	b. The second requirement of a good control strategy is that it should be
	systematic.
</p>
<p>
	IV. A rule applier: Production rule is like below if(condition) then
	consequence or action
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Algorithm for Production System:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	1. Represent the initial state of the problem
</p>
<p>
	2. If the present state is the goal state then go to step 5 else go to step
	3
</p>
<p>
	3. Choose one of the rules that satisfy the present state, apply it and
	change the state to new state.
</p>
<p>
	4. Go to Step 2
</p>
<p>
	5. Print "Goal is reached " and indicate the search path from initial state
	to goal state 6. Stop
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Classification of Production System:</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Based on the direction they can be
</p>
<p>
	1. Forward Production System
</p>
<p>
	a. Moving from Initial State to Goal State
</p>
<p>
	b. When there are number of goal states and only one initial state, it is
	advantage to use forward production system.
</p>
<p>
	2. Backward Production System
</p>
<p>
	a. Moving from Goal State to Initial State
</p>
<p>
	b. If there is only one goal state and many initial states, it is advantage
	to use backward production system.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Production System Characteristics</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Production system is a good way to describe the operations that can be
	performed in a search for solution of the problem.
</p>
<p>
	Two questions we might reasonably ask at this point are:
</p>
<p>
	a. Can production systems, like problems, be described by a set of
	characteristics that shed some light on how they can easily be implemented?
</p>
<p>
	<em>b. </em>
	<em>
		If so, what relationships are there between problem types and the types
		of production
	</em>
	<em> systems best suited to solving the problems?</em>
</p>
<p>
The answer for the first question can be considered with the following	<em>definitions of classes of production systems</em>:
</p>
<p>
	A monotonic production system is a production system in which the
	applications of a rule never prevents the later application of another rule
	that could also have been applied at the time the first rule was selected.
</p>
<p>
	A non-monotonic production system is one which this is not true.
